    "contentMarkdown": "\n## 📝 Quick Summary: \nqui is a fast, single-binary web UI for qBittorrent that allows users to manage multiple qBittorrent instances from a single interface. It automates torrent workflows, supports cross-seeding across trackers, and offers features like scheduled backups and a reverse proxy.\n\n## 🔑 Key Takeaways\n\n- ✅ qui is a high-performance, modern web interface replacing the default qBittorrent UI, optimized for large torrent collections.\n\n- ✅ It features robust multi-instance support, allowing centralized management of all your qBittorrent clients from one dashboard.\n\n- ✅ The project is distributed as a single, dependency-free binary, ensuring easy and quick deployment via Linux or Docker.\n\n- ✅ Advanced features like rule-based Automations and native Cross-Seed functionality automate complex torrent management tasks.\n\n- ✅ Scheduled backups, restore functionality, and a built-in reverse proxy enhance reliability and integration capabilities.\n\n\n## 📊 Project Statistics\n- ⭐ Stars: 2472\n- 🍴 Forks: 72\n- ❗ Open Issues: 12\n\n\n## 🛠 Tech Stack\n- ✅ Go\n\n\nImagine trying to manage several qBittorrent instances across different servers, or dealing with a massive library of torrents that slows down the default web interface. It’s frustrating, right? That’s where **qui** steps in. This project isn't just another skin for qBittorrent; it's a complete, modern overhaul designed from the ground up to handle high demands and complex setups effortlessly. It solves the pain point of slow, dated interfaces and the headache of juggling multiple remote clients by offering a unified, high-performance solution.\n\nThe core genius of qui lies in its simplicity and performance. It’s distributed as a single, lightweight binary with zero dependencies. You just download it, run the `serve` command, and you instantly have a blazing-fast web UI ready to go. This \"single binary\" approach is a dream for deployment, whether you're running it directly on Linux or deploying via Docker, making installation friction practically nonexistent. Even if your torrent collection stretches into the tens of thousands, qui remains responsive, unlike many legacy interfaces that struggle under such load.\n\nBut qui’s functionality extends far beyond being just a pretty face. Its most powerful feature is the built-in support for managing multiple qBittorrent instances from a single application dashboard. If you separate your traffic or use different servers for specific tasks, qui centralizes control, eliminating the need to constantly switch tabs or log into different interfaces. This consolidation dramatically streamlines your entire workflow, saving significant time and cognitive load, especially for developers managing infrastructure for home labs or larger media stacks.\n\nFor power users, the integrated automation and Cross-Seed features are game-changers. The automation system allows you to define rule-based actions—think \"if this condition is met, then perform this action.\" This means you can set up sophisticated management logic without scripting external tools. Furthermore, the native Cross-Seed functionality automatically finds and adds matching torrents across your configured trackers, maximizing your ratios and overall contribution effortlessly. Developers will appreciate how these features move complex, previously manual tasks into a clean, integrated interface.\n\nFinally, qui offers crucial reliability features that matter in production environments. It includes scheduled backups and restore capabilities, allowing you to take snapshots of your configuration. If something goes wrong, recovery is quick and painless. Plus, it acts as a transparent reverse proxy for qBittorrent, which simplifies integration with external applications that might need to interact with the client API. If you are looking to modernize your media stack or simply want a powerful, fast, and unified way to manage your torrent clients, qui is an absolute must-see project that brings enterprise-level management features to the world of torrenting.\n\n## 📚 Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/autobrr/qui)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
