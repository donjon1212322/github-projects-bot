This is where \r\n`hours` shines. It\r\n’s a beautifully simple, no-frills toolkit designed specifically for developers who live in the command line. Its core purpose is to eliminate friction from time logging, making it so fast that you actually use it consistently, especially for those crucial side-project hours that often slip through the cracks. It prioritizes ease of use over fancy, unnecessary features, ensuring your focus remains on development.\r\n\r\nThe heart of \r\n`hours` is its intuitive Terminal User Interface, or TUI. Forget complex menus and endless clicks. When you run the \r\n`hours` command, you are greeted with a clean interface that lets you manage everything\r\n—creating new tasks, updating existing ones, and most importantly, starting or stopping the timer\r\n—often with just a single keypress. This focus on speed and minimalism means you spend less time managing the tracker and more time coding. It\r\n’s built for efficiency, allowing you to quickly log manual entries or view historical data without ever leaving your current terminal session.\r\n\r\nBut \r\n`hours` isn't just a timer; it\r\n’s a powerful reporting engine. After tracking your time, you can instantly generate useful plaintext outputs using subcommands like \r\n`report`, \r\n`log`, and \r\n`stats`. Need to know exactly how much time you spent on project X yesterday? Run \r\n`hours report yest`. Want a detailed log of every session this week? The \r\n`log` command provides that clarity. These reports can be aggregated and customized by specific dates or ranges, providing a transparent overview of your time allocation without forcing you into proprietary data formats or heavy dashboards. The interactive report view is particularly useful for quick visualization.\r\n\r\nFor developers, the biggest benefit is maintaining flow state. By keeping time tracking entirely within the terminal environment, \r\n`hours` drastically reduces the cognitive load associated with switching tools and environments. It respects the developer workflow. Whether you are tracking billable client work or just trying to measure your personal learning investment, this tool gives you quick, actionable data in a format (plaintext) that is easy to parse, share, or integrate into other scripts. It\r\n’s the perfect companion for anyone who values speed, simplicity, and staying rooted in the power of the command line. Stop wrestling with bloated time trackers and give this lightweight, powerful utility a try.\n\n## 📚 Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/dhth/hours)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
