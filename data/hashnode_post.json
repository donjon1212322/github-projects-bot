Ever wished you had a supercharged, self-hosted torrent search engine right at your fingertips? Well, hold onto your hats, because I've stumbled upon something truly amazing: bitmagnet! This isn't your grandpappy's torrent indexer; it's a whole ecosystem packed into one sleek package.  Imagine a system that crawls the DHT network, indexes torrents, classifies content, and even integrates with your favorite Servarr apps (like Radarr and Sonarr).  That's bitmagnet in a nutshell. But let's dive a little deeper. \n\nAt its core, bitmagnet is a self-hosted application. This means you have complete control over your data and privacy. No more relying on potentially unreliable or questionable public trackers. You're in charge! The system works by crawling the Distributed Hash Table (DHT) network, which is a peer-to-peer network used by BitTorrent clients to discover torrents. bitmagnet intelligently sifts through this massive amount of data, indexing relevant torrents and classifying them based on their content. This means you can easily search for exactly what you need, without sifting through endless irrelevant results. \n\nBut what truly sets bitmagnet apart is its integration with the Servarr suite of applications. If you're a fan of automating your media library management, this will blow your mind. bitmagnet seamlessly integrates with Radarr (for movies), Sonarr (for TV shows), and other similar apps. This means that once you've found a torrent, you can automatically import it into your media management system, saving you hours of manual work.  It's like having a personal torrent librarian working 24/7. \n\nBeyond the core functionality, bitmagnet offers a beautiful web UI and a powerful GraphQL API. The UI is intuitive and easy to navigate, even for those not familiar with torrenting.  The GraphQL API allows for seamless integration with other applications and custom scripts, opening up a world of possibilities for automation and customization. You can build custom dashboards, integrate it with your home automation system – the possibilities are endless! \n\nFor developers, the benefits are numerous.  Imagine the time saved by automating torrent management and media library organization.  The ability to build custom integrations and extend bitmagnet's functionality is a game-changer.  The project's open-source nature means you can contribute to its development, learn from the codebase, and even adapt it to your specific needs.  It's a powerful tool, a fascinating project, and a great opportunity to contribute to the open-source community.  It's not just a torrent indexer; it's a platform for innovation!\n\n## 📚 Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/bitmagnet-io/bitmagnet)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
