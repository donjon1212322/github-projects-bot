Tired of juggling multiple apps and services to get things done? Alice integrates voice interaction, intelligent context awareness, and powerful tooling into one sleek package. Imagine a personal assistant that understands your needs, remembers past conversations, and even interacts with your computer's file system. That's Alice. \n\nAlice's magic lies in its seamless blend of cutting-edge technologies. Under the hood, you'll find Vue.js and Electron for a responsive and cross-platform experience.  Pinia handles state management, ensuring a smooth workflow.  OpenAI's powerful language models provide the brains, allowing Alice to understand and respond naturally to your requests.  Need to find a file?  Just ask! Want to schedule a reminder?  No problem! Alice can even generate images and interact with services like Google Calendar and Gmail. \n\nBut what truly sets Alice apart is its context awareness. Alice remembers previous interactions, allowing for more natural and meaningful conversations.  This isn't just a chatbot; it's a true AI companion that learns and adapts to your workflow.  This level of context allows for a more human-like interaction, making your experience more efficient and enjoyable. The underlying architecture uses a combination of short-term and long-term memory mechanisms to achieve this impressive feat.
