    "contentMarkdown": "\n## 📝 Quick Summary: \nOTS is a one-time-secret sharing platform that uses AES 256-bit encryption in the browser to protect secrets. The server never receives the password, and the secret is deleted after the first read, ensuring maximum security for sensitive information.\n\n## 🔑 Key Takeaways\n\n- ✅ Client-side encryption ensures the server never sees your secrets.\n\n- ✅ One-time access means your secret is deleted immediately after retrieval.\n\n- ✅ Flexible backend options allow for easy integration into existing infrastructure.\n\n- ✅ Simple and intuitive CLI tool for easy creation and retrieval of secrets.\n\n- ✅ Open-source and community-driven, fostering transparency and collaboration\n\n\n## 📊 Project Statistics\n- ⭐ Stars: 519\n- 🍴 Forks: 72\n- ❗ Open Issues: 7\n\n\n## 🛠 Tech Stack\n- ✅ Go\n\n\nEver wished you could share sensitive information securely without trusting a central server?  Meet OTS, the One-Time Secret Sharing platform!  This isn't your typical secret-sharing service; OTS prioritizes your privacy by encrypting your secrets *before* they ever hit the server.  Think of it as a secure digital envelope that self-destructs after the recipient opens it. \n\nHere's the magic: OTS uses robust 256-bit AES encryption. This means your secrets are scrambled using a powerful algorithm, making them practically unreadable without the correct key.  The crucial part?  You, and only you, hold the key. The server receives only the encrypted data and a unique identifier; it never sees the actual secret, eliminating the risk of a data breach on the server side. Once someone retrieves the secret using the unique URL and password you've provided, the secret is immediately deleted from the server.\n\nOTS is incredibly versatile. You can use it for sharing passwords, API keys, license codes, or any sensitive data you need to transmit securely. The system is designed to be easily integrated into your existing workflows. You can create and retrieve secrets using the CLI (command-line interface), making it perfect for scripting and automation.   The CLI tool is also highly configurable, allowing you to specify options like the secret's expiry time, or even attach files to your secret.\n\nThe platform supports various backend storage options, including an in-memory option for testing and a Redis option for persistent storage. This flexibility ensures you can adapt OTS to your infrastructure needs.  Whether you're a solo developer or part of a large team, OTS provides a secure and convenient way to handle sensitive information. The benefits are clear: increased security, improved workflow efficiency, and peace of mind knowing your secrets are protected.\n\nThe project's open-source nature allows for community contributions and ensures transparency. It's a testament to the power of decentralized security and a great example of how we can build more secure systems.  Give it a try – you might be surprised at how simple and effective it is!\n\n## 📚 Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/Luzifer/ots)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
