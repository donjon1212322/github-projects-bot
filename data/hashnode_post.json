The repository provides the source code, licensed under MIT, to improve the existing game, build additional tools, study game development, or create entirely new turn-based strategy games. The codebase is modular, with packages focusing on data structures, game state, rendering, and UI.\n\n## üîë Key Takeaways\n\n- ‚úÖ Open-source turn-based strategy game built with JavaScript.\n\n- ‚úÖ Modular architecture allows focusing on specific components (engine, AI, UI, etc.).\n\n- ‚úÖ Great learning opportunity and chance to contribute to a real-world project.\n\n- ‚úÖ Active community and detailed documentation ensure a smooth onboarding experience.\n\n- ‚úÖ Uses modern tools and best practices (pnpm, clear code structure).\n\n\n## üìä Project Statistics\n- ‚≠ê Stars: 1772\n- üç¥ Forks: 130\n- ‚ùó Open Issues: 6\n\n\n## üõ† Tech Stack\n- ‚úÖ TypeScript\n\n\nHey fellow devs! Ever wished you could dive into the code of a real-world game, learn from a professional-grade architecture, and maybe even contribute to its evolution? Well, hold onto your hats, because Athena Crisis is here to blow your minds! This isn't just another game; it's an open-core turn-based strategy game with a significant portion of its source code available on GitHub under the MIT license.  Think of it as a massive, collaborative coding playground, built with cutting-edge JavaScript and a modular architecture that's both impressive and surprisingly approachable.  The project is split into several packages, each responsible for a specific aspect of the game. This means you can focus on the part that interests you most ‚Äì be it the game engine, the AI, the user interface, or even the data structures that power the entire game. Want to learn about efficient game state management? Check out the 'apollo' and 'athena' packages.  Curious about how a modern JavaScript game engine works? Dive into 'hera'.  The modular design makes it easy to understand the individual components and how they work together. One of the coolest things about Athena Crisis is its commitment to open-source principles.  Not only can you learn from the existing code, but you can also contribute your own improvements, new features, or even create entirely new games based on its architecture. Imagine extending the game with new units, maps, or even game modes ‚Äì all thanks to the power of open source. This isn't just a learning opportunity, though.  Contributing to Athena Crisis also gives you a chance to build your portfolio, gain experience working on a large-scale project, and connect with other talented developers. The project is actively maintained and has a supportive community, making it a great place to learn and grow.  The documentation is thorough, and the community is welcoming, making it easy to get started, even if you're new to game development.  If you're looking to level up your JavaScript skills, understand how to build a complex game, or just want to contribute to an awesome project, Athena Crisis is the place to be. The project utilizes pnpm for package management and offers detailed setup instructions, ensuring a smooth onboarding experience. For Windows users, the documentation even provides specific configurations to ensure a hassle-free setup with git bash.  The project boasts an impressive set of tools, including a code generator for game actions and responses, ensuring consistency and maintainability. The architecture emphasizes separation of concerns, making the codebase easier to navigate and understand. This thoughtful design makes it ideal for developers of all levels, from those new to game development to seasoned professionals looking for a new challenge. It's a perfect blend of learning, collaboration, and fun. So, what are you waiting for? Head over to the GitHub repository, clone the project, and get ready to be amazed!\n\n## üìö Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/athena-crisis)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
