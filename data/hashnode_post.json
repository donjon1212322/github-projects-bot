It acts as a bridge, allowing LLMs to control assets, scenes, scripts, and automate tasks within Unity using the Model Context Protocol.\n\n## 🔑 Key Takeaways\n\n- ✅ MCP for Unity enables direct interaction between LLMs (like Claude) and the Unity Editor via natural language commands.\n\n- ✅ It acts as a bridge using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Client, translating conversational instructions into actionable Unity API calls.\n\n- ✅ Developers gain powerful tools for automating asset management, scene manipulation, GameObject configuration, and running tests.\n\n- ✅ Specialized functions like `script_apply_edits` allow AI to perform precise, structural edits to C# code safely and atomically.\n\n- ✅ This project significantly speeds up workflow by automating repetitive tasks, allowing developers to focus on higher-level design.\n\n\n## 📊 Project Statistics\n- ⭐ Stars: 4254\n- 🍴 Forks: 569\n- ❗ Open Issues: 25\n\n\n## 🛠 Tech Stack\n- ✅ C#\n\n\nAre you tired of the repetitive grind in the Unity Editor? We all know the drill: clicking through menus, finding assets, tweaking components, and context-switching constantly between your code editor and Unity itself. What if you could simply *tell* your AI assistant—like Claude or Cursor—exactly what you wanted done in Unity, and it just happened? That's the revolutionary promise of MCP for Unity, a powerful project that acts as the ultimate communication bridge between modern Large Language Models (LLMs) and your game development environment.\n\nMCP for Unity introduces the ability to use natural language to control complex Unity workflows. It achieves this by implementing a local Model Context Protocol (MCP) Client. Think of this client as a highly specialized interpreter. When you give an instruction to your AI assistant, that assistant uses the MCP to send a structured command to the Unity Editor bridge. This bridge then executes the command using a rich set of specialized tools built right into the package. It uses an HTTP-first transport layer, making the connection robust and fast, moving beyond basic standard input/output methods.\n\nThe core power lies in these functional tools. Instead of just generating code snippets that you then have to manually copy and paste, the LLM is given direct, functional access to the Unity environment. This includes essential tools like `manage_asset` for importing or modifying resources, `manage_gameobject` for manipulating scene elements and components, and `manage_scene` for loading or saving scenes. This isn't just theoretical; it means you can instruct the AI to \"Find all materials named 'Metal_Rust' and change their primary color to blue,\" or \"Create a new C# script named 'EnemyAI' in the Scripts folder and attach it to the Player GameObject.\" The automation potential here is immense.\n\nOne of the most exciting advancements is in script management. Traditional AI often struggles with making surgical, context-aware edits to existing codebases without introducing errors. MCP for Unity solves this with specialized functions like `apply_text_edits` and `script_apply_edits`. These allow the LLM to perform precise, atomic changes to C# scripts—inserting a method, replacing a function body, or deleting a class—all while maintaining structural integrity. There's even a `validate_script` tool to catch syntax issues before the change is finalized. This level of control drastically reduces the need for manual copy-pasting and ensures faster, safer AI-driven code integration directly within your project.\n\nFor developers, the benefits are clear: unprecedented automation and reduced friction. Repetitive setup tasks, boilerplate creation, asset manipulation, and even running unit tests can now be automated purely through conversational commands. If you want to future-proof your Unity workflow and leverage the cutting edge of AI-assisted development, diving into MCP for Unity is a must. It fundamentally transforms the way you interact with your projects, moving you from tedious clicking and typing to high-level strategic instruction.\n\n## 📚 Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
