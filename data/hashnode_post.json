    "contentMarkdown": "\n## üìù Quick Summary: \nnanochat is a full-stack implementation of an LLM similar to ChatGPT, designed to be minimal, hackable, and run on a single 8XH100 node. It covers the entire pipeline from tokenization to web serving, allowing users to train and interact with their own LLM. The repository provides scripts for pretraining, finetuning, evaluation, and inference, with a focus on accessibility and customization.\n\n## üîë Key Takeaways\n\n- ‚úÖ Nanochat is a minimal, full-stack LLM implementation covering the entire pipeline from tokenization to web serving.\n\n- ‚úÖ It is highly hackable and dependency-lite, serving as an ideal educational tool for understanding LLM internals.\n\n- ‚úÖ Developers can train a functional, end-to-end LLM instance for approximately $100 using the provided `speedrun.sh` script.\n\n- ‚úÖ The project includes a simple, ChatGPT-like web UI for immediate inference and interaction with the trained model.\n\n- ‚úÖ It offers unparalleled control, allowing developers to tweak and experiment with every aspect of the LLM architecture and training process.\n\n\n## üìä Project Statistics\n- ‚≠ê Stars: 25311\n- üç¥ Forks: 2530\n- ‚ùó Open Issues: 23\n\n\n## üõ† Tech Stack\n- ‚úÖ Python\n\n\nHave you ever felt like modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are fascinating black boxes? We use them daily, but understanding the full pipeline‚Äîfrom raw data to a conversational web interface‚Äîoften requires navigating complex, multi-framework projects. Nanochat cuts through that complexity. It‚Äôs a full-stack, end-to-end implementation of an LLM pipeline, designed specifically to be clean, minimal, and fully hackable. This project isn't just a component; it's the entire blueprint, allowing developers to truly own and understand their AI.\n\nNanochat encompasses every stage required to build a conversational model, including tokenization, pretraining, fine-tuning, evaluation, inference, and even serving the result via a simple web UI that looks just like ChatGPT. The beauty of this approach is its dependency-lite nature. It provides a singular, cohesive codebase that you can easily dive into and modify, making it an incredible resource for education or deep experimentation.\n\nFor developers eager to jump straight into the action, the project offers a quick start via the `speedrun.sh` script. This script trains the entry-level $100 tier of nanochat. Running on an 8XH100 node, the entire process takes about four hours. You boot up your cloud instance, launch the script, and wait for your personal LLM to be born. Once complete, you simply run the web server script, and instantly, you have a fully functional chat interface connected to the model you just trained.\n\nWhy should developers care about training a micro-model that might be a bit naive or prone to hallucination? Because control equals knowledge. Nanochat is the ultimate sandbox for learning LLM internals. If you want to experiment with different Transformer layer counts, adjust optimization schedules, or see exactly how the evaluation metrics are generated, this project gives you the keys to the kingdom. It demystifies the entire process, transforming the LLM development cycle from an opaque operation into a transparent, customizable workflow. It‚Äôs about moving beyond being just a user of AI and becoming a builder and modifier of the core technology itself.\n\n## üìö Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
