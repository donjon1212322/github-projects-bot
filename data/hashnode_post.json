    "contentMarkdown": "\n## 📝 Quick Summary: \nminesweep-rs is a terminal-based implementation of the classic Minesweeper game, built using the Rust programming language and the tui-rs library for creating the user interface. It offers a fun and engaging way to play Minesweeper directly in your command line.\n\n## 🔑 Key Takeaways\n\n- ✅ A high-performance, fully interactive Minesweeper game built entirely for the terminal environment.\n\n- ✅ Uses Rust for reliability and speed, combined with `tui-rs` (ratatui) for dynamic, beautiful console rendering.\n\n- ✅ Serves as an excellent learning resource for developers interested in building complex Text User Interface (TUI) applications in Rust.\n\n- ✅ Demonstrates clean implementation of core game logic (state management and input handling) within a modern CLI framework.\n\n\n## 📊 Project Statistics\n- ⭐ Stars: 207\n- 🍴 Forks: 7\n- ❗ Open Issues: 1\n\n\n## 🛠 Tech Stack\n- ✅ Rust\n\n\nAre you tired of jumping between graphical windows just to take a quick break? Meet `minesweep-rs`, a brilliant demonstration of what modern command-line interfaces can achieve. This isn't just a simple text-based game; it's a fully interactive, beautifully rendered version of the classic Minesweeper, running entirely within your terminal window. It solves the developer problem of context switching by bringing fun, high-quality entertainment directly into the environment where we spend most of our time.\n\nThe core genius of this project lies in its technology stack. It’s built using Rust, a language known for its speed, memory safety, and concurrency, ensuring the game runs smoothly and reliably, even when you're flagging those corners under pressure. The visual magic comes from `tui-rs` (now often referred to as `ratatui`), a powerful library that allows developers to construct complex, dynamic user interfaces right in the console. Instead of rendering pixels on a screen, it manipulates characters and colors within the terminal grid, resulting in an incredibly lightweight yet surprisingly rich graphical experience.\n\nFor developers, `minesweep-rs` serves as an invaluable blueprint. If you've ever considered building a serious, interactive CLI application—perhaps a dashboard, a monitoring tool, or even your own custom terminal game—this project provides a clean, idiomatic example of how to structure state management and rendering loops in Rust. You can explore how the game handles user input, manages the game board state (which cells are revealed, which are flagged, where the mines are), and then efficiently redraws only the necessary parts of the TUI using the framework.\n\nThis project is a compelling argument that the terminal is far from dead. It shows that robust, engaging, and high-performance applications can live entirely outside the browser or traditional desktop environments. By studying the codebase, developers can gain practical insights into implementing core game logic—like recursive cell revealing and neighbor counting—in a safe and performant language like Rust. It’s not just a fun distraction; it's a masterclass in modern command-line application development. Plus, since it's packaged in a Docker container, you can instantly try it out with a single command, making exploration incredibly easy. This immediate accessibility lowers the barrier to entry for both playing and learning from the source code.\n\n## 📚 Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/cpcloud/minesweep-rs)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
