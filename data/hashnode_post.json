    "contentMarkdown": "\n## 📝 Quick Summary: \nSpeedtest Tracker is a self-hosted PHP application that automates internet speed tests and monitors connection performance over time. It captures detailed metrics, stores historical data, and provides notifications for performance drops.\n\n## 🔑 Key Takeaways\n\n- ✅ Speedtest Tracker provides continuous, automated monitoring of crucial internet performance metrics like speed, ping, and packet loss.\n\n- ✅ The project is easily deployed using Docker containers, supporting platforms like Synology and Unraid for reliable self-hosting.\n\n- ✅ Historical data visualization allows users to identify long-term trends and intermittent connection issues that manual tests often miss.\n\n- ✅ Customizable notification thresholds alert you instantly when network performance drops below acceptable limits, enabling proactive issue resolution.\n\n\n## 📊 Project Statistics\n- ⭐ Stars: 5175\n- 🍴 Forks: 203\n- ❗ Open Issues: 46\n\n\n## 🛠 Tech Stack\n- ✅ PHP\n\n\nAre you tired of blaming your ISP only to find out your home network setup is the bottleneck? Or maybe you just need solid, undeniable proof that your internet speeds are consistently dropping below what you pay for? That's exactly where Speedtest Tracker steps in. This fantastic self-hosted project gives you the ultimate control panel for monitoring your connection health, moving beyond sporadic manual tests to provide continuous, reliable data.\n\nThe core purpose of Speedtest Tracker is continuous performance monitoring. Instead of relying on a single test run when you feel things are slow, this application allows you to schedule automated speed tests. Think of it as having a dedicated, tireless quality assurance engineer constantly checking your connection 24/7. It runs tests at regular intervals, capturing critical metrics like download speed, upload speed, ping, and even packet loss—data points often overlooked by simple speed checkers.\n\nHow does it work under the hood? It’s designed for modern deployment, leveraging containerization. The project is distributed as a Docker image, making installation incredibly smooth whether you are running a dedicated server, a Raspberry Pi, or a NAS platform like Synology or Unraid. This containerized approach ensures that the environment is consistent and isolated, guaranteeing that the speed tests are run reliably without interference from other processes on your host machine. Once deployed, you simply configure the testing schedule, and the tracker takes over the heavy lifting.\n\nThe real power lies in the data visualization and alerting capabilities. All those automated test results are stored and displayed in a clean, comprehensive dashboard. Developers and self-hosters can easily view historical data and trends over weeks or months, transforming raw numbers into actionable insights. This historical perspective is crucial for identifying performance patterns, detecting intermittent issues, or proving long-term degradation that might require contacting your service provider.\n\nFor developers maintaining home labs or running critical services, this tool is invaluable for maintaining system integrity. Uptime and latency are paramount for remote access and deployed applications. Speedtest Tracker allows you to set up customized notification thresholds. If your upload speed suddenly tanks, or your ping spikes above an acceptable level, the system immediately alerts you through various channels. This proactive alerting means you can address network issues before they impact your deployed services, saving you significant debugging time and potential headaches. Furthermore, its built-in multi-language support, driven by community translations, demonstrates a strong commitment to user experience and accessibility. It’s more than just a speed checker; it's a diagnostic powerhouse built for modern infrastructure monitoring.\n\n## 📚 Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/alexjustesen/speedtest-tracker)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
