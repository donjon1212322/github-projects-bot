    "contentMarkdown": "\n## 📝 Quick Summary: \nThe `chrome-devtools-mcp` repository provides a Model-Context-Protocol (MCP) server that allows coding agents (like Gemini or Copilot) to control and inspect a live Chrome browser. It leverages Chrome DevTools and Puppeteer to enable reliable automation, in-depth debugging, and performance analysis for AI coding assistants.\n\n## 🔑 Key Takeaways\n\n- ✅ `chrome-devtools-mcp` transforms AI coding assistants into dynamic browser debuggers by exposing the full power of Chrome DevTools.\n\n- ✅ It facilitates reliable browser automation using Puppeteer, ensuring robust testing and interaction with complex web applications.\n\n- ✅ Developers can gain immediate, AI-driven performance insights by having the agent record and analyze traces automatically.\n\n- ✅ The project enables advanced debugging, allowing AI to inspect network requests, console output, and capture precise screenshots during runtime.\n\n- ✅ It acts as a Model-Context-Protocol (MCP) server, bridging the gap between AI agents and live browser environments.\n\n\n## 📊 Project Statistics\n- ⭐ Stars: 15396\n- 🍴 Forks: 948\n- ❗ Open Issues: 47\n\n\n## 🛠 Tech Stack\n- ✅ TypeScript\n\n\nImagine giving your AI coding assistant not just the ability to write code, but the actual power to *see* and *interact* with a live web browser, just like a human developer using DevTools. That's exactly what `chrome-devtools-mcp` achieves. This project bridges the gap between powerful AI agents and the complex, dynamic environment of the modern web, transforming your assistant from a static code generator into a dynamic debugger and tester.\n\nThis tool functions as a Model-Context-Protocol (MCP) server. Think of the MCP server as a sophisticated translator and facilitator. It takes high-level requests from your coding agent—say, \"check the performance trace of this button click\" or \"debug why this network request failed\"—and translates those into precise commands that Chrome DevTools understands. Essentially, it opens up the full suite of Chrome's inspection capabilities directly to the AI, allowing the agent to not only read the Document Object Model (DOM) but also dive deep into the browser's internal workings.\n\nFor developers, this capability is a massive game-changer for automation and debugging efficiency. Since the project leverages Puppeteer for reliable interaction, the automation steps are incredibly robust. The AI doesn't just blindly click elements; it can intelligently wait for specific conditions, ensuring actions are performed correctly even on complex single-page applications. This translates directly into faster, more reliable end-to-end testing and immediate, contextual feedback during development cycles.\n\nOne of the most compelling features is the ability to extract actionable performance insights without manual effort. Instead of you manually recording a trace and trying to interpret the waterfall diagram, your AI agent can be instructed to run a trace and then immediately analyze the data. The agent can pinpoint bottlenecks, suggest specific code fixes, and even explain *why* a particular script caused a layout shift, all without you having to spend hours digging through performance metrics.\n\nFurthermore, `chrome-devtools-mcp` provides advanced debugging capabilities that go far beyond simple console logs. Your AI can analyze network traffic, inspect the browser console output in real-time, and capture screenshots at critical moments during a test run. If a bug only appears under specific circumstances, the AI can reliably reproduce the environment, gather comprehensive evidence, and present a detailed diagnostic report, drastically cutting down on triage time. By integrating this MCP server into tools like Gemini, Claude, or Copilot, developers gain a super-powered assistant capable of deep, contextual browser interaction, making debugging sessions much more efficient and allowing you to focus on solving the underlying problems rather than just finding them.\n\n## 📚 Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
