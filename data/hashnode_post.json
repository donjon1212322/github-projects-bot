It supports a range of smart glasses and offers a developer console and app store for extending functionality.\n\n## 🔑 Key Takeaways\n\n- ✅ MentraOS is an open-source operating system designed to eliminate fragmentation in the smart glasses market.\n\n- ✅ It provides a unified API layer, allowing developers to build applications once for multiple supported AR devices (e.g., Mentra Mach 1, Even Realities G1).\n\n- ✅ The project includes a full ecosystem with a Developer Console and Mentra Store for streamlined app deployment and distribution.\n\n- ✅ Developers gain control and transparency, with the ability to contribute directly to the core operating system's features and performance.\n\n- ✅ MentraOS lowers the barrier to entry for spatial computing development by offering standardized tooling and open architecture.\n\n\n## 📊 Project Statistics\n- ⭐ Stars: 1716\n- 🍴 Forks: 215\n- ❗ Open Issues: 382\n\n\n## 🛠 Tech Stack\n- ✅ TypeScript\n\n\nMentraOS is fundamentally changing how we approach development for wearable augmented reality devices. Historically, creating apps for smart glasses has meant grappling with proprietary SDKs and platforms tied to specific, closed hardware ecosystems. MentraOS tears down these walls by offering a fully open-source operating system designed specifically for smart glasses, aiming to standardize the development layer across diverse hardware. This project isn't just a kernel; it’s a complete framework encompassing everything needed to run spatial applications seamlessly, supporting devices like the Mentra Mach 1 and Even Realities G1 right out of the box.\r\nThe way MentraOS works is relatively straightforward: it acts as a unified middleware layer. Whether you are using one brand of smart glasses or another, the underlying OS provides consistent APIs for handling display output, spatial inputs, and sensor data. This abstraction means that developers write their applications once using the Mentra SDK, and the OS handles the specific hardware translations. This approach drastically reduces fragmentation, a major headache in the nascent AR space, allowing developers to focus purely on the user experience rather than hardware compatibility matrices. Companion mobile apps are also available for both iOS and Android, ensuring seamless integration with users' existing devices.\r\nFor developers, the immediate benefit is access to a rapidly growing, centralized ecosystem. The platform already features a functional Mentra Store with real-world applications—think utilities like live captions and spatial communication tools—proving the viability of the architecture. Furthermore, the robust Developer Console provides the tools necessary for packaging, testing, and deploying apps directly to users. This streamlined deployment process lowers the barrier to entry significantly compared to traditional, often opaque, hardware vendor ecosystems, accelerating time-to-market for new spatial applications.\r\nThe true power of MentraOS lies in its open-source nature. Because the entire operating system is transparent and community-driven, developers gain unprecedented control. If a specific feature is missing or a performance bottleneck is identified, the community can contribute fixes and enhancements directly to the core OS. This is a crucial differentiator: you are not just building *on* a platform; you are helping to *build* the platform itself. This level of collaboration ensures that the OS evolves rapidly to meet the real-world needs of spatial developers and users, positioning MentraOS as the definitive future standard for open augmented reality.\n\n## 📚 Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/Mentra-Community/MentraOS)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
