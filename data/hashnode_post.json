It supports a wide range of formats and codecs, aiming to provide high-performance media operations with zero dependencies and tree-shakable bundling.\n\n## 🔑 Key Takeaways\n\n- ✅ Mediabunny enables complex media operations (conversion, trimming, resizing) to run entirely client-side in the browser.\n\n- ✅ It is built in pure TypeScript with zero dependencies, ensuring maximum performance and a minimal bundle size (highly tree-shakable).\n\n- ✅ Leverages the WebCodecs API for hardware-accelerated encoding and decoding, resulting in very fast processing times.\n\n- ✅ Supports streaming I/O, allowing developers to handle very large video and audio files efficiently without memory issues.\n\n- ✅ Acts as an in-browser alternative to server-side tools like FFmpeg, reducing server costs and latency.\n\n\n## 📊 Project Statistics\n- ⭐ Stars: 3955\n- 🍴 Forks: 130\n- ❗ Open Issues: 24\n\n\n## 🛠 Tech Stack\n- ✅ TypeScript\n\n\nHave you ever tried to build a web application that needs to handle video or audio manipulation? Typically, this means setting up a complex backend infrastructure, relying on heavy server-side tools like FFmpeg, and waiting for slow round trips just to trim a video or change a file format. It’s expensive, slow, and creates unnecessary latency. What if you could do all of that heavy lifting right in the user’s browser, instantly and without touching your server?\n\nThat’s exactly where Mediabunny hops in. This project is a complete, pure JavaScript media toolkit designed to read, write, and convert popular media files like MP4, WebM, and MP3, all running client-side. Think of it as bringing the core functionality of a professional media library, traditionally reserved for the server, directly into the web environment. This shifts the computational burden away from your infrastructure and onto the client device.\n\nMediabunny achieves this incredible performance because it was written from scratch in pure TypeScript and boasts zero external dependencies. It’s not just fast; it’s built for modern web standards. Crucially, it leverages the powerful WebCodecs API, allowing it to utilize hardware acceleration for encoding and decoding processes. This means your video conversions or resizing operations are lightning-fast, limited only by the user's hardware, not your server's queue.\n\nFor developers, the benefits are huge. You can now implement features that were previously complex or impossible on the client. Imagine offering users microsecond-accurate video trimming, real-time format conversion (transmuxing or transcoding), resizing, or cropping, all happening instantly. Since Mediabunny supports streaming I/O, it can efficiently handle reading and writing files of virtually any size without overwhelming the browser's memory, making it ideal for large video uploads.\n\nFurthermore, the project is designed with efficiency in mind. It is extremely tree-shakable, meaning you only bundle the specific functions you use. This keeps the library footprint incredibly small—as little as 5 kB gzipped—ensuring that integrating powerful media tools doesn't bloat your application’s initial load time. If you’re building anything that touches video or audio on the web, Mediabunny is a game-changer that deserves a look.\n\n## 📚 Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/Vanilagy/mediabunny)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
