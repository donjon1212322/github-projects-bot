It employs both source code analysis using Semgrep rules and package metadata heuristics to identify security threats.\n\n## 🔑 Key Takeaways\n\n- ✅ GuardDog is a CLI tool designed to detect malicious packages across major ecosystems (PyPI, npm, Go, GitHub Actions, VSCode Extensions).\n\n- ✅ It uses a combination of source code heuristics, powered by Semgrep, and package metadata analysis to identify suspicious behavior.\n\n- ✅ Developers can scan remote registry versions, local archives, or verify entire dependency lists from files like requirements.txt.\n\n- ✅ Integrating GuardDog into CI/CD pipelines automates software supply chain security risk mitigation.\n\n- ✅ The tool provides actionable, structured output formats like JSON and SARIF for easy integration with existing security workflows.\n\n\n## 📊 Project Statistics\n- ⭐ Stars: 911\n- 🍴 Forks: 75\n- ❗ Open Issues: 30\n\n\n## 🛠 Tech Stack\n- ✅ Python\n\n\nIn today's development landscape, relying on third-party packages is standard practice, but it introduces significant supply chain risks. Every time you run 'pip install' or 'npm install', you are essentially trusting code you haven't reviewed, potentially opening the door to malware, backdoors, and data exfiltration hidden within malicious packages. This is the critical problem GuardDog is designed to solve: providing a quick, reliable way to audit these dependencies before they compromise your project.\n\nGuardDog operates as a simple, yet powerful, command-line interface (CLI) tool. Its core function is to identify suspicious behavior in packages sourced from major ecosystems, including PyPI, npm, Go modules, GitHub Actions, and even VSCode extensions. Instead of relying solely on static signature matching, GuardDog employs a robust set of heuristics—essentially rules that look for the tell-tale signs of malicious intent or dangerous coding practices.\n\nThe scanning process is comprehensive. When you point GuardDog at a package (either a remote version from the registry or a local archive/directory), it downloads and analyzes both the source code and the package metadata. For deep code analysis, it leverages Semgrep rules. These rules are crucial because they hunt for specific patterns that indicate danger, such as obfuscated API calls, attempts at dynamic code execution, or suspicious file system interactions. It’s like having an automated security expert reviewing the code line by line, looking for common tricks used by malicious actors.\n\nCrucially, GuardDog doesn't stop at just the source code. It also analyzes metadata—the information surrounding the package on the registry. This includes checking for suspicious version history, sudden maintainer changes, or strange dependencies, which often hint at typosquatting or package hijacking attacks. By combining rigorous source code analysis and metadata checks, GuardDog provides a holistic and accurate risk assessment.\n\nFor developers, the benefit is immediate security assurance and streamlined workflow integration. You can easily integrate GuardDog into your CI/CD pipelines using commands like 'guarddog pypi verify requirements.txt' to automatically check all dependencies referenced in your project files. This means you catch risky packages before they ever make it into your production environment. Whether you are scanning the latest version of a popular library, auditing a specific archived file, or checking a new GitHub Action before integrating it, GuardDog gives you actionable, machine-readable results, including support for output formats like SARIF for seamless integration with existing security tooling. This tool transforms dependency auditing from a tedious manual task into a simple, automated command, making it essential for anyone serious about mitigating the rising threat of software supply chain attacks without slowing down development speed.\n\n## 📚 Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/DataDog/guarddog)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
