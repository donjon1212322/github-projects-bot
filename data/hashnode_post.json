    "contentMarkdown": "\n## 📝 Quick Summary: \nLeantime is an open-source project management system designed for non-project managers. It combines strategy, planning, and execution with a focus on ease of use, incorporating features like Kanban boards, Gantt charts, and goal tracking. It aims to be a simpler alternative to tools like Jira and ClickUp.\n\n## 🔑 Key Takeaways\n\n- ✅ Leantime is an open source, all-in-one project management system designed for simplicity and accessibility, serving as a powerful alternative to Jira, ClickUp, or Asana.\n\n- ✅ It is uniquely built with neuro-inclusivity in mind, offering a clean interface optimized for users with ADHD, dyslexia, and autism.\n\n- ✅ The platform combines execution (Kanban, sprints, time tracking) with strategic planning (SWOT analysis, Goal tracking, Lean Canvas).\n\n- ✅ Developers benefit from easy Docker deployment, robust API access, and plugin extensibility for deep integration into existing workflows.\n\n- ✅ It covers the full project lifecycle, from initial idea generation (Idea Boards) to final retrospective analysis.\n\n\n## 📊 Project Statistics\n- ⭐ Stars: 8467\n- 🍴 Forks: 817\n- ❗ Open Issues: 246\n\n\n## 🛠 Tech Stack\n- ✅ PHP\n\n\nLet's be honest: navigating most enterprise project management tools feels like fighting through a bureaucratic jungle. They are often overloaded, confusing, and designed for certified project managers, not the developers, designers, or content creators who actually need to get work done. This is where Leantime steps in, offering a breath of fresh air as an open source project management system built specifically for non-project managers.\n\nLeantime’s core mission is to simplify the complex relationship between strategy, planning, and execution. Instead of forcing you into rigid workflows, it provides a flexible environment that feels as simple as Trello but packs the power of tools like Jira or ClickUp. What truly sets it apart, however, is its commitment to inclusivity; it was built with neurodiversity in mind, specifically catering to individuals with ADHD, dyslexia, and autism, ensuring a less overwhelming, clearer interface for everyone.\n\nFunctionally, Leantime covers the entire project lifecycle. You can manage tasks using familiar views like Kanban boards for visual workflow, Gantt charts for dependency tracking, and traditional list or calendar views. It handles unlimited subtasks, dependencies, and full sprint management for agile teams. But it doesn't stop at task tracking. Leantime integrates high-level strategic tools like Goal & metrics tracking, Lean & Business Model Canvases, and SWOT analysis directly into the system. This means your team can move seamlessly from brainstorming an idea on the Idea Boards to executing it, all within the same platform.\n\nFor developers, the open source nature is a massive win. Leantime is easily deployable via Docker, giving you full control over your data and infrastructure. It offers robust administration features, including LDAP and OIDC integration for authentication, and it's highly extensible. The platform supports plugins and a comprehensive API, allowing you to integrate it deeply into your existing development toolchain, whether you need hooks into Slack, Mattermost, or Discord. This extensibility makes Leantime a truly adaptable and future-proof solution.\n\nIf you are tired of paying exorbitant licensing fees or battling overly complicated interfaces just to track a few tasks, Leantime is the powerful, community-driven alternative you need. It reduces context switching, streamlines complex planning, and provides a clear, focused workspace so your team can spend less time managing the project and more time building.\n\n## 📚 Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/Leantime/leantime)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
