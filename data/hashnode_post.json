Ever felt a little uneasy about the security of those cool Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers you're using?  I know I have. That's why I'm super excited to share this awesome GitHub project: Ramparts, an MCP security scanner!  Think of it as a comprehensive security checkup for your MCP servers, helping you identify potential vulnerabilities before they become a problem. \n\nMCP is amazing for letting AI agents access all sorts of resources, but this power comes with responsibility.  Ramparts helps you shoulder that responsibility.  It scans your MCP servers for weaknesses, like unauthorized file access, risky database queries, or even sneaky command injection attempts.  It's like having a security guard for your AI's digital world.\n\nSo, how does it work?  Ramparts uses a multi-pronged approach. First, it thoroughly explores your MCP server, identifying all available tools and resources.  Then, it employs a combination of clever static analysis rules and the power of AI to detect potential vulnerabilities.  It doesn't just flag problems; it also provides clear, actionable recommendations to fix them. Imagine having a smart assistant that not only finds the problems but also tells you how to solve them! This is a huge time saver, especially for those complex security issues that can take hours to track down.\n\nThe best part?  Ramparts is designed to be user-friendly. You don't need to be a security expert to use it. The interface is intuitive, and the results are presented in a way that's easy to understand.  Whether you're building your own MCP servers or using third-party ones, Ramparts gives you peace of mind, ensuring your AI agents are interacting with the world safely and securely.  It's a must-have tool for anyone serious about building and using secure MCP-based applications.  Integrating Ramparts into your development workflow is a simple way to significantly improve your application's security posture.\n\nBut it's not just about security; it's also about efficiency. By proactively identifying vulnerabilities, Ramparts helps prevent costly security breaches and saves you countless hours of debugging and troubleshooting.  It's an investment in the long-term health and security of your projects.  Plus, it makes you look like a security rockstar to your team and clients!\n\n## 📚 Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/getjavelin/ramparts)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
