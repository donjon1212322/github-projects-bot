Then you absolutely HAVE to check out `timr-tui`, a fantastic little command-line tool built with Rust and Ratatui.  It's a TUI (Text User Interface), meaning it runs in your terminal, making it super lightweight and accessible.  Forget about clunky time management apps; this one's clean, efficient, and gets the job done.\n\n`timr-tui` gives you three core modes: Pomodoro, Countdown, and Timer.  The Pomodoro mode is perfect for focused work sessions, breaking your time into intervals with short breaks in between—ideal for avoiding burnout.  The Countdown timer is great for anything from short workout sessions to longer meditation periods, offering customizable durations.  And the simple Timer is there for those times you just need to keep track of how long something's taking.\n\nWhat makes `timr-tui` stand out is its flexibility.  You can customize the duration of your Pomodoro sessions, the length of your breaks, and even the visual style of the timer itself!  Want to add deciseconds for extra precision?  No problem.  Need a different color scheme? `timr-tui` has you covered.  The options are extensive, allowing you to tailor the experience to your exact needs and preferences.\n\nThe best part?  It's incredibly easy to use.  Installation is a breeze—a simple `cargo install timr-tui` command and you're ready to go.  The interface is intuitive and straightforward, making it easy to jump in and start using it right away.  No steep learning curve here!  Plus, it's incredibly lightweight, putting minimal strain on your system resources.\n\nBeyond the core functionality, `timr-tui` also offers some advanced features.  Mission Elapsed Time (MET) tracking is built-in, useful for those who work on projects with strict time constraints.  Desktop notifications are also supported (though experimental), allowing you to stay on track without constantly staring at your terminal.  The developers have clearly thought of everything, making this a truly comprehensive time management solution for developers.\n\nIf you're tired of juggling multiple apps to manage your time while coding, `timr-tui` is a game-changer. Its simplicity, customizability, and powerful features make it a must-have for any developer who wants to boost their productivity and stay focused.  Give it a try—you won't regret it!\n\n## 📚 Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/sectore/timr-tui)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
