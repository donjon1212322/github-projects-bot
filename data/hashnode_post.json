You can even configure it to play an audio alert on your desktop for critical events.  Setting up Telert is a breeze.  Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, you'll find the process incredibly straightforward.  The command-line interface is intuitive, and the documentation is clear and concise.  Telert's architecture is modular, allowing for easy extension and customization.  Want to add support for a new notification service?
