    "contentMarkdown": "\n## 📝 Quick Summary: \ngitlogue is a terminal-based tool that transforms your Git commit history into a cinematic, animated replay. It visualizes code changes with realistic typing animations, syntax highlighting, and file tree transitions, making the evolution of code an engaging visual experience.\n\n## 🔑 Key Takeaways\n\n- ✅ Gitlogue transforms static Git diffs into cinematic, animated commit replays directly in the terminal.\n\n- ✅ It uses realistic typing simulations, cursor movements, and Tree-sitter for beautiful syntax highlighting across many languages.\n\n- ✅ Key use cases include educational demos, high-impact live presentations, and ambient terminal screensavers.\n\n- ✅ Built with Rust, the tool is fast, lightweight, and highly customizable, allowing control over themes and typing speed rules.\n\n- ✅ It provides a powerful, visual way to understand codebase evolution and onboard new developers quickly.\n\n\n## 📊 Project Statistics\n- ⭐ Stars: 3682\n- 🍴 Forks: 83\n- ❗ Open Issues: 7\n\n\n## 🛠 Tech Stack\n- ✅ Rust\n\n\nHave you ever stared at a standard `git log` output and wished you could actually *see* the code being written, line by line, just like in a movie? Most of the time, Git history is a dry list of hashes and messages. That's where a fantastic new project called `gitlogue` steps in to completely revolutionize how we view our development history. It transforms boring commit diffs into a captivating, animated terminal experience.\n\n`gitlogue` is essentially a cinematic playback tool for your Git repository. Instead of just showing you the final changes, it meticulously replays the commit process with realistic typing animations, cursor movements, and deletions. Imagine watching a developer type out the exact changes that went into a crucial feature commit. It's not just a static display; it's a dynamic visual narrative of code evolution. This is achieved using the power of Rust for speed and efficiency, and advanced features like Tree-sitter for beautiful, accurate syntax highlighting across nearly 30 programming languages.\n\nHow does it work? When you run `gitlogue` on a repository, it analyzes the diff and then simulates the creation of those files and changes in a clean, split-screen terminal interface. You see the project file tree structure update in real-time alongside the animated code editor, which handles operations like file creation and deletion seamlessly. You can use it to view a single specific commit, loop through a range of commits for a continuous display, or even use its default mode as an ambient, constantly updating screensaver for your workspace. It even has a dedicated mode for visualizing staged or unstaged changes before you commit them, offering a unique diff view.\n\nFor developers, the benefits are immediately apparent. If you're onboarding a new team member, you can use `gitlogue` to visually walk them through the history of a complex module, making the evolution of the codebase tangible and easy to grasp. For presentations or content creation, it provides a stunning, high-impact way to demo code changes live, far more engaging than simply scrolling through a static diff file. Plus, let's be honest, setting it up as a \"Look Busy Mode\" during long meetings is a fun, practical perk! It even allows for granular control over playback, letting you adjust typing speed globally or even set different speeds for different file types—maybe Java files get typed slowly, while quick config file changes zip by.\n\nThis tool isn't just a novelty; it's a genuine enhancement to how we interact with version control. It takes the often-abstract concept of code history and makes it a visual, memorable story. If you spend any significant time in the terminal, `gitlogue` deserves a spot in your toolkit for its utility, performance, and sheer coolness factor. It’s a powerful and highly customizable utility that injects life back into your command line workflow.\n\n## 📚 Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/unhappychoice/gitlogue)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
