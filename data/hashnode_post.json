    "contentMarkdown": "\n## üìù Quick Summary: \nTheoremExplainAgent (TEA) is an AI system designed to generate Manim videos that visually explain mathematical theorems. It aims to provide a deeper understanding of theorems by uncovering reasoning flaws that might be hidden in text-based explanations. The system utilizes LLM agents and multimodal explanations to create engaging and informative video content.\n\n## üîë Key Takeaways\n\n- ‚úÖ Visualizes complex mathematical theorems using dynamic animations.\n\n- ‚úÖ Combines LLM reasoning with Manim animations and TTS for multimodal explanations.\n\n- ‚úÖ Serves as an educational resource, debugging tool, and a showcase of AI integration.\n\n- ‚úÖ Offers flexibility with multiple LLM backend options.\n\n- ‚úÖ Open-source and community-driven, encouraging collaboration and contributions\n\n\n## üìä Project Statistics\n- ‚≠ê Stars: 1259\n- üç¥ Forks: 156\n- ‚ùó Open Issues: 13\n\n\n## üõ† Tech Stack\n- ‚úÖ Python\n\n\nHey fellow developers! Ever wished you could visualize complex mathematical theorems in a way that's both engaging and insightful?  Meet TheoremExplainAgent (TEA), a groundbreaking project that's doing just that!  Imagine watching a dynamic, animated video that not only explains a theorem step-by-step but also highlights potential pitfalls in the reasoning. That's the magic of TEA.  This isn't your grandma's static textbook illustration; this is a full-blown, AI-powered explainer that leverages the power of Manim, a powerful animation library, to create captivating visuals.  It's like having a personal math tutor who can break down abstract concepts into easily digestible pieces.\n\nTEA works by combining the strengths of several cutting-edge technologies.  At its core, it's a large language model (LLM) trained to understand and reason about mathematical theorems.  This LLM isn't just passively reciting definitions; it actively analyzes the theorem's structure, identifies key steps in the proof, and even pinpoints potential flaws or areas of ambiguity.  The results are then elegantly transformed into a Manim animation, resulting in a dynamic and visually rich explanation. This isn't just about showing; it's about showing *why*.  The animation isn't just a pretty face; it's a carefully crafted visual narrative that helps you understand the underlying logic.\n\nBut TEA doesn't stop there. To make the explanations even more accessible, it incorporates text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities, allowing for an audio narration of the visual explanation.  This is a game-changer for accessibility and learning. The combination of visual and auditory elements creates a truly multimodal learning experience, catering to diverse learning styles. The project uses Kokoro, a high-quality TTS model, for clear and natural-sounding narration. The team has thoughtfully provided options for various LLM backends, including OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Google Vertex AI, and more, ensuring flexibility and accessibility for developers with different preferences and cloud setups.\n\nSo, what's in it for you?  As a developer, TEA offers several compelling benefits. First, it provides a fantastic educational resource for learning complex mathematical concepts.  Second, it serves as a powerful debugging tool, helping you identify potential flaws in your own mathematical reasoning or code. Third, the project's architecture is a masterclass in combining different AI technologies.  Studying TEA's codebase will help you learn how to effectively integrate LLMs, animation libraries, and TTS systems.  Finally, TEA opens up exciting possibilities for creating engaging educational content in other domains beyond mathematics.  Imagine using similar techniques to explain complex algorithms, software architectures, or even scientific concepts. The potential is limitless!\n\nSetting up TEA is straightforward, thanks to a well-structured README file and conda environment.  The installation process is clearly outlined, and the team has provided extensive documentation and FAQs to address common issues.  The ability to choose from multiple LLM backends gives you the flexibility to select the provider that best suits your needs and budget.  The project is open-source, fostering collaboration and community contributions, making it a vibrant and active project to be a part of.  This isn't just a project; it's a community dedicated to making complex ideas easier to understand.\n\n## üìö Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/TheoremExplainAgent)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
