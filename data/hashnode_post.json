Stop dreaming, because `cpdown` is here! This fantastic browser extension is a game-changer for anyone who works with web content, especially developers.  Imagine needing to pull information from a website for documentation, a blog post, or even just a quick reference.  Manually copying and pasting, then painstakingly cleaning up the HTML mess, is a huge time-waster.  `cpdown` elegantly solves this problem.\n\nThis little gem uses a clever combination of techniques to achieve its magic. It leverages powerful libraries like Defuddle and Mozilla's Readability to intelligently extract the main content of a webpage, filtering out the noise – think ads, sidebars, and other distracting elements. Then, it seamlessly converts that extracted content into beautifully formatted markdown.  It's not just about simple text; it preserves headings, lists, and other important structural elements, making the resulting markdown incredibly clean and easy to work with.  The result?  A perfectly formatted markdown version of the webpage's core content, ready to be pasted directly into your document.\n\nBut `cpdown` goes above and beyond basic text extraction. If you're a YouTube aficionado who often needs to incorporate subtitles into your projects, you'll love this feature!  `cpdown` can also grab YouTube subtitles and convert them into markdown format with a single click. This is a massive time-saver for anyone working with video content.  Think educational videos, tutorials, or even just gathering quotes for research.  This feature alone could save you hours of tedious manual transcription.\n\nBeyond the core functionality, `cpdown` is packed with features that enhance the developer experience.  It offers keyboard shortcuts for lightning-fast copying, a token counter for those working with large language models (LLMs), and highly customizable settings to tailor the output to your exact needs.  You can choose between Defuddle and Readability for content extraction, wrap your output in triple backticks for code blocks, and even enable a fun confetti animation (if you're a Raycast user!).\n\nThe installation process is a breeze.  It's available on the Chrome Web Store, with Firefox support coming soon.  Even manual installation is straightforward, thanks to clear instructions in the GitHub repository.  `cpdown` is built using a modern tech stack, including React, Tailwind CSS, and other popular libraries, demonstrating a commitment to maintainability and a polished user experience.  The project's open-source nature also fosters community involvement and continuous improvement.\n\nIn short, `cpdown` is more than just a browser extension; it's a productivity booster for developers and content creators alike. Its ability to effortlessly transform messy web content into pristine markdown is a significant advantage, saving time and effort on countless tasks.  The addition of YouTube subtitle extraction elevates it further, making it an indispensable tool for anyone working with video content.  Give it a try—you won't regret it!\n\n## 📚 Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/ysm-dev/cpdown)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
