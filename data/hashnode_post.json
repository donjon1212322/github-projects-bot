Ever wished you had a single, super-easy-to-use command-line tool to query data from practically *any* source?  Meet `rsql`, the amazing project that's changing the way I interact with databases and data files. Forget juggling multiple clients and struggling with inconsistent interfaces; `rsql` unites them all under one roof.\n\nImagine this: you're working on a project involving data spread across several databases – maybe a PostgreSQL instance, a few CSV files, some JSON data, and even a couple of Parquet files.  Traditionally, you'd need different tools to query each one.  `rsql` elegantly solves this problem. It supports an incredibly wide range of data sources, from relational databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and CockroachDB to NoSQL databases, cloud data warehouses like Snowflake and Redshift, and various file formats like CSV, JSON, Parquet, and more.  The list is extensive, and it's constantly growing!\n\nBut it's not just about the sheer number of supported sources.  `rsql` is incredibly user-friendly.  It boasts a clean, intuitive interface with features like syntax highlighting, query auto-completion, and a handy command history.  Say goodbye to endless scrolling through documentation; `rsql` makes querying data a breeze.  The installation is a snap too – just a single command, whether you're on Linux, macOS, or Windows.\n\nThe real magic lies in its consistent experience.  No matter the data source, the core interaction remains the same. You write your SQL queries, hit enter, and get your results. It handles the complexities of connecting to different systems and translating your queries into the correct format for each one. This saves a ton of time and reduces the cognitive load, letting you focus on the data itself rather than the technicalities of accessing it.\n\nFor developers, the benefits are clear.  `rsql` drastically reduces the time spent on data exploration and analysis.  You can quickly prototype queries, experiment with different approaches, and gain valuable insights from your data without the hassle of switching between multiple tools. It's also invaluable for debugging and troubleshooting data-related issues, providing a unified way to inspect data across various sources. The consistent interface means you spend less time learning new tools and more time building awesome applications.\n\nBeyond its core functionality, `rsql` also supports various compression formats (Brotli, Gzip, Zstd, and more), ensuring efficient handling of large datasets. Its well-structured architecture and active development community make it a robust and reliable tool for the long term.  Seriously, this project is a game-changer for anyone who works with data!\n\n## 📚 Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/theseus-rs/rsql)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
