Ever wished for a super-smooth, collaborative coding interview experience?  I just stumbled upon this amazing GitHub project, and I'm so excited I had to share it. It's a React Vite template designed specifically to make remote technical interviews a breeze. Forget about the usual hassle of setting up shared coding environments – this template streamlines the whole process.\n\nThe magic happens with the `CodeTogether Live` extension for VS Code.  The interviewer hosts a session, and the candidate simply joins using a shared link.  No more juggling multiple screens or dealing with complicated setup instructions.  The interviewer can run the project locally using `npm run vite.dev`, and the candidate accesses the live SPA remotely. It's seamless and intuitive.\n\nWhat makes this template truly special is its simplicity and speed.  It's built on Vite, so everything is lightning-fast.  The project is minimal, focusing on essential features like Prettier for code formatting, built-in HTTPS for security, and even ESLint and commitlint for code quality.  This means less time fiddling with configurations and more time focusing on what really matters: the interview itself.\n\nFor candidates, it's a fantastic experience. They can focus on showcasing their skills without getting bogged down in technical setup. For interviewers, it's a huge time saver, eliminating the overhead of managing complex shared environments.  The built-in tools also help maintain a consistent and professional interview process.\n\nBut wait, there's more! The project is easily customizable. It provides a solid foundation that you can expand upon.  You can add more complex features or tailor it to your specific interview needs.  The `README.md` is clear and concise, making it easy to get started. The use of Vite ensures rapid development cycles, allowing for quick prototyping and iterations.\n\nThis project isn't just about technical interviews. It's a testament to how streamlined collaborative coding can be. It's a great example of how well-designed tools can make a significant difference in our daily workflow.  It's efficient, user-friendly, and frankly, a game-changer for anyone involved in remote coding collaborations. Go check it out; you won't regret it!\n\n## 📚 Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
