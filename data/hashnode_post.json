    "contentMarkdown": "\n## 📝 Quick Summary: \nWinShot is a modern, lightweight screenshot tool for Windows that offers advanced capture modes, rich annotation tools, non-destructive editing, and flexible export options. It aims to provide a superior user experience with a glassmorphism UI and significantly smaller file size compared to Electron-based applications.\n\n## 🔑 Key Takeaways\n\n- ✅ WinShot is built with Wails (Go + React), resulting in a minimal footprint (~10MB) and native performance, significantly outperforming typical Electron apps.\n\n- ✅ It features powerful, non-destructive annotation tools, including auto-incrementing numbers and a 'Spotlight' feature for creating professional documentation and tutorials.\n\n- ✅ Supports flexible capture modes (Region, Window, Fullscreen) triggered by customizable global hotkeys for rapid workflow integration on Windows.\n\n- ✅ The application boasts a modern, aesthetically pleasing glassmorphism UI combined with robust export options and settings persistence.\n\n- ✅ Its lightweight nature ensures it minimizes resource consumption, allowing developers to run it alongside demanding IDEs without performance penalties.\n\n\n## 📊 Project Statistics\n- ⭐ Stars: 136\n- 🍴 Forks: 35\n- ❗ Open Issues: 10\n\n\n## 🛠 Tech Stack\n- ✅ TypeScript\n\n\nIf you’ve ever felt frustrated waiting for your screenshot utility to load, or if you are tired of applications hogging system resources just to capture a simple image, then you need to pay attention to WinShot. This project is a genuine game-changer for Windows developers and power users who demand performance without sacrificing features. It solves the perennial problem of sluggish, oversized utility apps by adopting a radically different approach: leveraging Wails, a framework that combines the power of Go for the backend with modern web technologies like React for a beautiful frontend. The result? An application that clocks in at a tiny 10MB—a staggering 90% smaller than typical Electron-based competitors—while delivering true native speed.\n\nWinShot isn't just fast; it’s incredibly feature-packed. The core functionality covers all the capture modes you need: full screen, specific windows, or custom regions, all accessible via global, customizable hotkeys. This focus on system integration ensures that capturing an image is always just a quick shortcut away, minimizing workflow interruptions.\n\nBut where it truly shines is in the editing suite. Forget destructive edits where you immediately lose your original context after drawing a shape. WinShot offers non-destructive annotations, meaning you can move, resize, or delete any shape, arrow, or text box at any time, even after applying it. This flexibility is crucial when you are refining complex technical diagrams or tutorial steps.\n\nFor creating technical documentation or step-by-step tutorials, the annotation tools are superb. You can utilize auto-incrementing numbered markers, which is perfect for guiding users through a process, or use the powerful \"Spotlight\" feature to highlight critical areas by elegantly dimming the rest of the image. Furthermore, the UI itself is a delight, sporting a modern glassmorphism design that looks sleek and professional while remaining lightweight.\n\nDevelopers should care about WinShot because it streamlines the creation of high-quality visual communication. When submitting detailed bug reports, writing comprehensive READMEs, or documenting new features, clear, professionally annotated screenshots are essential. WinShot’s ability to quickly capture, professionally annotate, and export in various optimized formats (PNG/JPEG with built-in ratio presets) drastically cuts down on the friction in your documentation workflow. Plus, its minimal resource footprint ensures it won't slow down your primary development environment, making it the perfect lightweight utility companion that stays out of your way until you need it. This combination of speed, power, and elegance makes WinShot a must-have tool for optimizing developer efficiency on Windows.\n\n## 📚 Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/mrgoonie/winshot)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
