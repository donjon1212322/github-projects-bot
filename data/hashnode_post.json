It prioritizes low resource consumption and user data privacy.\n\n## 🔑 Key Takeaways\n\n- ✅ Komari is an ultra-lightweight, self-hosted server monitoring tool designed for efficiency and low resource consumption.\n\n- ✅ The self-hosted architecture ensures complete data privacy and control, eliminating reliance on third-party SaaS providers.\n\n- ✅ It features an intuitive web dashboard and uses minimal agents to collect essential performance metrics from remote servers.\n\n- ✅ Deployment is fast and simple, supporting Docker, one-click scripts, and binary installation.\n\n- ✅ Ideal for small VPS, budget servers, or developers seeking infrastructure visibility without the complexity and bloat of enterprise solutions.\n\n\n## 📊 Project Statistics\n- ⭐ Stars: 3242\n- 🍴 Forks: 298\n- ❗ Open Issues: 54\n\n\n## 🛠 Tech Stack\n- ✅ Go\n\n\nAre you tired of server monitoring tools that feel heavier than the servers they are supposed to be watching? If your small VPS or development machine is groaning under the weight of resource-hungry monitoring agents, then you absolutely need to meet Komari. This project is a game-changer for anyone who values efficiency, privacy, and simplicity in their infrastructure management.\n\nKomari’s core appeal lies in its extremely lightweight footprint. It was built from the ground up to consume minimal resources, making it perfectly suited for servers of all sizes, especially those smaller, budget-friendly virtual machines where every megabyte of RAM counts. Unlike complex enterprise solutions, Komari keeps things simple yet effective, focusing purely on providing essential performance metrics without the unnecessary feature bloat.\n\nThe architecture is straightforward and developer-friendly. You deploy the main Komari server component, which acts as your central hub and provides the intuitive web dashboard. This server is where all your collected data lives and is beautifully visualized. Crucially, Komari is designed to be self-hosted. This means you maintain complete control over your operational data, ensuring maximum privacy and eliminating recurring subscription fees that often come with SaaS monitoring platforms.\n\nTo monitor a specific machine, you simply install the lightweight agent. This agent is the data collector, silently gathering metrics like CPU usage, memory consumption, and disk I/O, and securely reporting them back to your central Komari instance. Because the agent is so tiny and efficient, it barely registers on your system load. This separation of concerns—a central dashboard and distributed, minimal agents—is what makes Komari so powerful for maintaining low overhead.\n\nThe setup process is remarkably easy, supporting multiple deployment methods. Whether you prefer the simplicity of a quick one-click install script for systemd-based Linux distributions, the portability of Docker, or running a standalone binary, you can have your entire monitoring infrastructure up and running in minutes, not hours. The default configurations are sensible, but customization options for user credentials are also readily available via environment variables.\n\nFor developers and hobbyists, Komari is the perfect tool for maintaining visibility without complexity. Whether you are running a single personal website, managing a small fleet of game servers, or just need a simple, reliable dashboard for your development environment, Komari provides the real-time insights you need without forcing you into proprietary ecosystems. It’s monitoring done right: efficient, transparent, and entirely under your control, letting you focus on writing code instead of troubleshooting monitoring tools.\n\n## 📚 Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/komari-monitor/komari)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
