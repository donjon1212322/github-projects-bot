That frustration is exactly what `xleak` is designed to eliminate. This fantastic utility brings the full power of spreadsheet viewing and manipulation right into your terminal, making spreadsheet data instantly accessible and scriptable without relying on heavy graphical applications.\n\nAt its core, `xleak` is built on Rust and utilizes the incredibly fast `calamine` parser. This means speed is paramount—it handles massive `.xlsx`, `.xls`, and even `.ods` files with ease, offering lazy loading for files with thousands of rows so you aren't stuck waiting for memory-intensive operations. Instead of a clunky graphical interface, you get a beautiful, interactive Terminal User Interface (TUI) powered by `ratatui`. Data is intelligently rendered: numbers are aligned right, text left, and tables are formatted cleanly, providing clarity that plain text dumps often lack.\n\nThe interactive TUI mode is where `xleak` truly shines for developers and data analysts. You can seamlessly navigate between multiple sheets using simple keyboard shortcuts like Tab and Shift+Tab. Need to find a specific transaction or cell reference? The full-text search feature (just hit `/`) scans across all cells instantly, allowing quick navigation through huge datasets. If you're debugging or analyzing derived data, you can view the underlying Excel formula for any selected cell just by pressing Enter, and copy individual cells or entire rows to your system clipboard with a single keypress.\n\nFor automation and scripting, `xleak` is a game-changer. Beyond the interactive TUI, it offers powerful command-line export capabilities. Imagine piping data directly from a spreadsheet into another script—you can instantly convert complex Excel files into clean CSV, structured JSON, or plain text formats, all without ever opening a heavy desktop application. This flexibility allows developers to integrate spreadsheet data analysis directly into their existing command-line workflows and CI/CD pipelines, turning static reports into dynamic data sources. This blend of interactive viewing and robust, fast export functionality makes `xleak` an essential tool for anyone who regularly deals with spreadsheet data in a development environment.\n\n## 📚 Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/bgreenwell/xleak)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
