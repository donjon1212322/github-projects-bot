It's designed for simple installation, self-hosting, and efficient TCP traffic forwarding. Bore allows developers to easily share and test local applications without complex configurations.\n\n## üîë Key Takeaways\n\n- ‚úÖ Exposes local ports to the internet easily and securely\n\n- ‚úÖ Lightweight and efficient, built in Rust\n\n- ‚úÖ Simple installation across multiple platforms\n\n- ‚úÖ Supports self-hosting for maximum control and privacy\n\n- ‚úÖ Saves time and simplifies development workflows\n\n\n## üìä Project Statistics\n- ‚≠ê Stars: 9657\n- üç¥ Forks: 409\n- ‚ùó Open Issues: 5\n\n\n## üõ† Tech Stack\n- ‚úÖ Rust\n\n\nHey fellow developers! Ever wished there was a super simple way to expose your local development server to the internet without the hassle of complex configurations or port forwarding?  Meet `bore`, a tiny but mighty TCP tunnel built in Rust that's about to become your new best friend! Forget about complicated setups ‚Äì `bore` makes it ridiculously easy to share your local projects with the world.  Think of it as a supercharged, streamlined version of tools like ngrok or localtunnel, but with a focus on speed, simplicity, and the ability to self-host for maximum control.\n\nSo, how does this magic work?  `bore` acts as a bridge, connecting your local machine to a remote server. You tell `bore` which local port you want to expose (like the port your web server is running on), and it creates a secure tunnel to the `bore` server.  Then, the `bore` server gives you a public URL that you can share with anyone.  Boom! Your local server is now accessible from anywhere on the internet.\n\nOne of the coolest things about `bore` is its focus on efficiency. It's written in Rust, making it incredibly fast and lightweight.  The entire project is only around 400 lines of code ‚Äì that's less than many single functions in some larger projects!  This means it's incredibly easy to understand, modify, and even self-host on your own infrastructure.  No more relying on third-party services ‚Äì you're in complete control!\n\nThe installation process is a breeze. Whether you're on macOS, Linux, or Windows, `bore` offers various installation methods, including Homebrew, AUR, pre-built binaries, and even Docker. If you're a Rustacean, you can even build it from source using Cargo. This flexibility ensures that getting started with `bore` is quick and painless, regardless of your preferred development environment.\n\nBut why should *you* care about `bore`?  Because it saves you time and frustration! No more messing around with complex firewall configurations or port forwarding rules.  Sharing your local development environment with collaborators or testers is now a matter of seconds.  Imagine the time you'll save ‚Äì time that you can spend building awesome things instead of fighting with networking settings.\n\nMoreover, self-hosting `bore` gives you ultimate control over your data and privacy. You don't have to rely on a third-party service, ensuring that your traffic remains secure and private.  The simplicity of the codebase also makes it easy to audit for security vulnerabilities, offering an extra layer of peace of mind.\n\nIn short, `bore` is a game-changer for developers who need a simple, fast, and secure way to expose their local projects. It's lightweight, efficient, and incredibly easy to use. Give it a try ‚Äì you won't regret it!\n\n## üìö Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/ekzhang/bore)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
