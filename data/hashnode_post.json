It helps security researchers and investigators quickly determine the presence of an email or the availability of a username on various social, developer, and creator sites.\n\n## 🔑 Key Takeaways\n\n- ✅ Performs dual-mode scanning: fast OSINT checks for email registration and simultaneous username availability verification.\n\n- ✅ Supports bulk scanning via files and advanced wildcard-based username permutation generation for efficient branding and security checks.\n\n- ✅ Offers structured output formats (JSON/CSV) perfect for integrating results into automated security scripts or databases.\n\n- ✅ Features a modular architecture, making it easy for developers to contribute and add support for new platforms.\n\n- ✅ Includes robust features like proxy support and pre-scan proxy validation for reliable, high-volume operations.\n\n\n## 📊 Project Statistics\n- ⭐ Stars: 531\n- 🍴 Forks: 59\n- ❗ Open Issues: 6\n\n\n## 🛠 Tech Stack\n- ✅ Python\n\n\nTired of manually checking if that perfect username is available across GitHub, Reddit, and Instagram? Or maybe you need to quickly verify if a specific email address is registered on dozens of common sites for an OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) investigation? If you’ve ever found yourself clicking through endless sign-up forms just to check availability, you know how much time this process wastes. This is where User Scanner steps in, acting as your lightweight, lightning-fast digital detective, combining two crucial capabilities into a single command-line tool.\r\n\r\nUser Scanner is fundamentally a dual-mode system. On one hand, it excels at email OSINT. You feed it an email address, and it rapidly pings various platforms to determine if that email is registered. This is incredibly useful for security researchers, investigators, or even just confirming the digital footprint of a contact. The results are clear and unambiguous: Registered or Not Registered. It cuts through the noise and provides actionable intelligence instantly.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, its username scanning capability is a huge win for developers, marketers, and anyone focused on personal branding. Finding a unique handle that hasn't been snagged on every major platform is tough. User Scanner lets you input a desired username, and it simultaneously checks its status—Available, Taken, or Error—across social media, developer sites, and creator platforms. This ensures brand consistency without the tedious manual verification process.\r\n\r\nWhat makes this project truly powerful for developers is its built-in automation features. Forget scanning one username at a time; User Scanner supports bulk processing via input files. Even cooler, it includes wildcard-based username permutation. If your ideal name, \"johnnydev,\" is taken, you can use a permutation flag to automatically generate variations like \"johnnydev_official\" or \"johnnydev_io,\" and scan all of them instantly. This feature alone is a massive time-saver for securing your digital identity.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the architecture is designed for extensibility. It uses a fully modular system, meaning adding support for a new platform is straightforward. If you need to integrate User Scanner's output into a larger security pipeline or database, it offers multiple output formats, including structured JSON and CSV, which are perfect for programmatic consumption. For those dealing with rate limiting or geographical restrictions, the tool even supports proxy files and validates those proxies before scanning, ensuring robust and reliable operation even under heavy load. This level of detail and flexibility makes User Scanner a must-have utility in any developer's toolkit, transforming tedious reconnaissance into a single, efficient command.\n\n## 📚 Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/kaifcodec/user-scanner)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
