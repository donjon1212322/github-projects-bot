The collapsable lists and sidebar help keep things organized, even on complex projects, while the multi-level hierarchy ensures you can structure your projects in a way that makes sense for your workflow.  Beyond the core functionality, 4ga Boards offers a dark mode for those late-night coding sessions, a range of powerful keyboard shortcuts to speed up your workflow, and support for multiple languages.
