Meet Meetily, the open-source AI-powered meeting assistant that does just that!  Imagine focusing completely on the conversation, knowing that Meetily is diligently recording, transcribing, and summarizing everything in real-time.  No more post-meeting transcription struggles or missed action items.  Meetily is a game-changer for anyone who spends time in meetings.\n\nMeetily's magic lies in its clever combination of technologies.  It uses a powerful speech-to-text engine to accurately transcribe your meeting audio. This transcription is then fed into an AI model that intelligently summarizes the key discussion points, action items, and decisions made.  The beauty of it is that all this happens locally on your machine, ensuring your privacy. No data leaves your computer, making it secure and compliant with even the strictest data regulations.\n\nThe architecture is surprisingly straightforward.  Meetily consists of two main parts: a frontend application (the part you interact with) and a backend service. The frontend handles audio recording and user interaction, while the backend processes the audio using the speech-to-text engine and AI summarization model.  The backend is designed to be lightweight and efficient, running smoothly on most modern computers.  This makes Meetily incredibly accessible; no need for cloud servers or complex setups.\n\nFor developers, Meetily offers several compelling advantages. Firstly, it saves you valuable time that would otherwise be spent taking notes or transcribing recordings. This time can be reinvested in more productive tasks.  Secondly, Meetily's open-source nature allows you to customize and extend its functionality to suit your specific needs.  Want to integrate it with your existing project management tools? Go ahead!  The possibilities are endless.  Thirdly, contributing to Meetily's development is a fantastic opportunity to learn about and work with cutting-edge AI technologies like speech-to-text and natural language processing.  Finally, the project's emphasis on privacy is a big plus in today's data-conscious world.\n\nMeetily is more than just a tool; it's a step towards a more efficient and productive future for meetings. By automating the tedious aspects of note-taking, it empowers teams to focus on collaboration and innovation.  It's a project that truly embodies the power of open-source collaboration and AI to solve real-world problems.  Give it a try ‚Äì you won't be disappointed!\n\n## üìö Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/Zackriya-Solutions/meeting-minutes)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
