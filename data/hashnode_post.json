It facilitates the separation of read and write operations, enhancing scalability, performance, and maintainability, with added support for event-driven architecture concepts like event sourcing, sagas, and transaction outbox patterns.\n\n## 🔑 Key Takeaways\n\n- ✅ Implements CQRS to separate read (Queries) and write (Commands) operations for independent scaling and performance optimization.\n\n- ✅ Provides robust Event-Driven Architecture support, including Kafka integration and the Transactional Outbox pattern for reliable event publishing.\n\n- ✅ Simplifies complex distributed transactions using the Orchestrated Saga pattern with built-in compensation and recovery.\n\n- ✅ Offers advanced features like Streaming Handlers for real-time updates and automatic Mermaid diagram generation for documentation.\n\n- ✅ Enhances maintainability and testability through clear separation of concerns in the codebase, integrated easily with FastAPI and FastStream.\n\n\n## 📊 Project Statistics\n- ⭐ Stars: 26\n- 🍴 Forks: 4\n- ❗ Open Issues: 4\n\n\n## 🛠 Tech Stack\n- ✅ Python\n\n\nWe all know the headache of building complex, high-traffic applications where read and write operations constantly clash. When you try to scale your database, reads usually dominate, but your write logic (commands) often requires locking and complex transactions, slowing everything down. This is where the Python CQRS project steps in, offering a robust framework for implementing the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern right in your Python ecosystem.\n\nAt its core, CQRS separates your application into two distinct pathways: Commands and Queries. Commands are actions that change the state of your system—like \"Create User\" or \"Join Meeting.\" Queries are actions that simply retrieve data—like \"Get User Profile\" or \"List all Meetings.\" This separation allows you to optimize each side independently. For instance, you can use a fast, denormalized NoSQL database for reads (Queries) and a traditional transactional database for writes (Commands). Python CQRS provides the RequestHandler abstraction to manage these flows cleanly. Command Handlers execute state changes and can optionally produce domain events, while Query Handlers fetch and return data representations.\n\nThe real power of this framework lies in its deep integration with Event-Driven Architecture (EDA). After a Command executes, it can generate events (Notifications or ECST events) that are immediately published to a message broker like Kafka, which is fully supported via aiokafka. The framework includes an EventMediator and crucial support for the Transactional Outbox pattern. The Outbox ensures that the database transaction and the event publishing are treated as a single atomic unit. This is critical for building reliable distributed systems, guaranteeing that state changes and corresponding events are never out of sync, even if the system crashes mid-operation.\n\nFor developers working with modern microservices, Python CQRS offers several advanced features that dramatically simplify complexity. It supports the Orchestrated Saga pattern, which is essential for managing distributed transactions across multiple services. If one step fails, the Saga automatically triggers compensation actions, preventing inconsistent states. Furthermore, the inclusion of StreamingRequestHandler allows for handling real-time requests with progress updates, perfect for long-running tasks or data pipelines. The project even helps with documentation by automatically generating Sequence and Class diagrams using Mermaid, turning complex architecture into visual, understandable diagrams.\n\nBy adopting this framework, developers gain immediate benefits in scalability, performance, and maintainability. You can scale your read models independently of your write models. The clear separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to test, understand, and evolve. With built-in support for FastAPI and FastStream, integrating this pattern into modern Python web and streaming applications is straightforward, allowing teams to focus on business logic rather than boilerplate infrastructure setup. This project truly provides the scaffolding needed to build resilient, high-performance distributed systems in Python.\n\n## 📚 Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/vadikko2/python-cqrs)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
