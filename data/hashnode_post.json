    "contentMarkdown": "\n## 📝 Quick Summary: \nWZML-X is a Telegram bot built with Pyrogram that enhances file mirroring and cloning capabilities. It supports downloading from various sources like torrents, Mega, Google Drive, and direct links, then uploading to Google Drive, Telegram, Rclone clouds, or DDL servers.\n\n## 🔑 Key Takeaways\n\n- ✅ WZML-X is a Telegram bot for high-speed mirroring of files (links/torrents) directly to Google Drive, Telegram, or RClone clouds.\n\n- ✅ It uses powerful backends like Aria2c and qBittorrent, offering advanced features like selective file downloads from torrents.\n\n- ✅ The bot supports large file uploads (2GB+) to Telegram and provides user-specific customization for file naming, format, and organization.\n\n- ✅ Integration with RClone allows seamless transfer to dozens of cloud storage services via simple Telegram commands, automating complex workflows.\n\n- ✅ The project provides a robust, server-side solution, eliminating the need for local downloads during massive file transfers.\n\n\n## 📊 Project Statistics\n- ⭐ Stars: 1238\n- 🍴 Forks: 2062\n- ❗ Open Issues: 18\n\n\n## 🛠 Tech Stack\n- ✅ Python\n\n\nHave you ever struggled with downloading massive files only to immediately upload them to Google Drive or another cloud service? That intermediate step of local downloading is often slow, bandwidth-intensive, and completely unnecessary. WZML-X solves this core pain point by acting as a powerful, server-side transfer agent accessible entirely through Telegram.\n\nThis powerful bot acts as your personal cloud transfer assistant, living right inside Telegram. Its core mission is simple: take any file you point to—whether it's a direct download link, a torrent magnet, or even an existing file on another cloud—and seamlessly move or copy it to your Google Drive, Telegram saved messages, or any other RClone-supported storage provider. This eliminates the need to download large files to your local machine first, saving massive amounts of bandwidth and time.\n\nThe architecture is built on robust tools like Python's Pyrogram framework, integrating high-performance download managers like Aria2c and qBittorrent. When you send a command (like /mirror followed by a link), the bot handles the entire process server-side. For torrents, it offers intelligent file selection, meaning you don't have to download the entire package if you only need one specific file. This level of control is a huge time-saver when dealing with large datasets or media collections.\n\nFor developers, WZML-X offers unparalleled flexibility in automating data transfer workflows. Instead of writing custom scripts for different cloud providers or dealing with rate limits manually, you leverage RClone integration. This opens the door to dozens of storage backends, all managed through simple Telegram commands. Furthermore, the bot provides granular control over uploads to Telegram itself. You can set specific prefixes or suffixes for files, manage thumbnails per user, and even dictate whether files are uploaded as compressed documents or viewable media, ensuring organization is maintained regardless of the file size or type.\n\nThe implementation of Aria2c and qBittorrent means you get optimized speed and reliability for fetching source files. You can even configure seeding ratios and times directly through the bot settings, giving you full control over torrent management without ever leaving the chat interface. This project is a fantastic example of leveraging Telegram's platform capabilities to create a highly functional, distributed utility, making it an excellent resource for learning advanced Pyrogram and cloud integration techniques. If you frequently handle large file transfers or need a flexible mirroring solution accessible from any device, this bot is a game-changer.\n\n## 📚 Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/SilentDemonSD/WZML-X)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
