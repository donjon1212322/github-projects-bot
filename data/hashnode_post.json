It allows users to encrypt and decrypt files using various algorithms, generate and detect hash types, and hide files within images. The application is designed for educational purposes and personal use, with no internet permission or data collection.\n\n## üîë Key Takeaways\n\n- ‚úÖ Easy-to-use Android app for exploring cryptography, steganography, and hashing.\n\n- ‚úÖ Supports popular symmetric encryption algorithms (AES, DES, 3DES, Blowfish, ChaCha20).\n\n- ‚úÖ Includes a hash generator and detector for various algorithms (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, etc.).\n\n- ‚úÖ Allows hiding and extracting files within images (JPG/PNG) using steganography.\n\n- ‚úÖ Lightweight, privacy-focused, and open-source.\n\n\n## üìä Project Statistics\n- ‚≠ê Stars: 45\n- üç¥ Forks: 1\n- ‚ùó Open Issues: 1\n\n\n## üõ† Tech Stack\n- ‚úÖ Kotlin\n\n\nHey fellow developers! Ever wished you had a handy Android tool to play around with cryptography, steganography, and hashing?  Well, hold onto your hats, because CryptX is here to blow your mind! This isn't your average security library; it's a fully-fledged Android app built with Jetpack Compose, offering a user-friendly interface for experimenting with various cryptographic techniques.  Think of it as a digital sandbox where you can safely explore the fascinating world of secure coding without needing to dive into complex low-level implementations.\n\nCryptX is designed to be super easy to use.  The app provides a clean and intuitive interface, making it simple to encrypt and decrypt files using popular algorithms like AES, DES, 3DES, Blowfish, and ChaCha20.  No more wrestling with command-line tools or struggling to decipher cryptic documentation; CryptX handles all the heavy lifting, allowing you to focus on understanding the underlying cryptographic concepts.  The encryption and decryption process is simple and straightforward, offering a visual representation that clearly shows the results.\n\nBut CryptX doesn't stop at encryption! It also lets you explore the world of hashing. Generate MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and other types of hashes with ease.  The app even includes a hash detector, which attempts to guess the algorithm used to create a given hash. This is incredibly useful for learning how different hashing algorithms work and understanding their properties.  Moreover, the app maintains a history of your operations, allowing you to revisit past encryption, decryption, or hashing tasks.\n\nOne of the coolest features is the file steganography functionality. CryptX allows you to hide files within images (JPG and PNG), effectively concealing your data within seemingly innocent pictures. You can also extract these hidden files, making it a fun and practical way to explore the possibilities of steganography.  This feature is well-integrated into the UI, providing a step-by-step guide and visual feedback throughout the process.\n\nCryptX stands out because it's lightweight, requires no internet permission, doesn't collect any data, and keeps all your files securely stored in the 'Download/cryptx/' directory on your device.  This focus on privacy and security is a significant advantage, making it a trustworthy tool for educational or personal use. The app is entirely open source, so you can examine the code and contribute to its development. It's a great resource for learning about security best practices and seeing how cryptographic algorithms are implemented in a real-world application.\n\nWhile currently only available in English, plans are underway to add multi-language support.  The roadmap also includes exciting additions like RSA and ECC support, further enhancing its capabilities and making it even more valuable for developers looking to expand their knowledge of cryptography.  For now, it's a perfect tool for anyone wanting to get hands-on experience with these critical security concepts without dealing with complex SDKs or libraries. So, what are you waiting for? Download CryptX, start exploring, and become a cryptography master!\n\n## üìö Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/PersonX-46/CryptX)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
