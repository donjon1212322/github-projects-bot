    "contentMarkdown": "\n## 📝 Quick Summary: \nNeovate Code is a coding agent designed to enhance the development workflow. It offers functionalities such as code generation, bug fixing, code review, and test creation, and can be used in both interactive and headless modes.\n\n## 🔑 Key Takeaways\n\n- ✅ Neovate Code is an AI coding agent that operates directly within the command line interface (CLI).\n\n- ✅ It handles diverse tasks including code generation, bug fixing, refactoring to new languages (like TypeScript), and test creation.\n\n- ✅ The agent minimizes context switching by keeping development tasks within the terminal environment.\n\n- ✅ Users maintain control by reviewing and approving all proposed changes and tool executions.\n\n- ✅ Setup is straightforward, requiring only an npm install and configuration of an existing AI provider API key.\n\n\n## 📊 Project Statistics\n- ⭐ Stars: 1099\n- 🍴 Forks: 97\n- ❗ Open Issues: 23\n\n\n## 🛠 Tech Stack\n- ✅ TypeScript\n\n\nAre you tired of jumping between your terminal and various browser tabs just to handle common coding tasks? Imagine having a super-smart coding assistant right there in your command line, ready to tackle everything from generating complex functions to squashing annoying bugs. That's exactly what Neovate Code offers, and trust me, it’s a game-changer for developer productivity.\n\nNeovate, pronounced 'niːəʊveɪt', isn't just another AI wrapper; it's a dedicated coding agent built to enhance your entire development workflow directly from the command line interface (CLI). Think of it as pairing with an expert who never sleeps and lives inside your terminal. Its core purpose is to automate and accelerate those repetitive, time-consuming tasks that often break your flow state, allowing you to focus on higher-level architectural challenges.\n\nHow does it work? Once installed via npm, you simply invoke `neovate` (or the alias `neo`) and start describing what you need using natural language. Need to \"Add error handling to the user authentication function\"? Just type that in. Want to \"Refactor this component to use TypeScript\"? Neovate handles the heavy lifting. It utilizes powerful underlying AI models, which you configure using your own API keys and selected provider/model after a quick setup via the `/login` and `/model` commands. The agent understands your intent, analyzes your codebase context, and proposes concrete code changes right back in the terminal.\n\nThe beauty of Neovate lies in its sheer versatility. It excels far beyond simple code generation. Developers can use it for critical tasks like generating comprehensive unit tests for a service, performing swift code reviews, optimizing complex database queries, or even fixing subtle bugs that might otherwise take hours to manually trace. You remain completely in control throughout the process, reviewing the proposed changes and explicitly approving tool calls before they are executed, ensuring safety and accuracy in your codebase.\n\nThis project is a massive win for developers seeking efficiency. By integrating powerful AI capabilities directly into the terminal—the environment where most of us spend the majority of our time—Neovate minimizes disruptive context switching. This leads to less distraction, faster iterations, and ultimately, more time spent on innovative problem-solving rather than boilerplate maintenance. If you value a streamlined, powerful, and AI-enhanced CLI experience, Neovate Code is definitely the next tool you should be adding to your arsenal. It truly brings the power of a sophisticated coding assistant right where you need it most.\n\n## 📚 Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/neovateai/neovate-code)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
