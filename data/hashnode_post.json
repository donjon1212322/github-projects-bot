It offers middleware for controlling IP access, logging requests, detecting penetration attempts, and configuring CORS. The library provides features like IP whitelisting/blacklisting, rate limiting, automatic IP banning, and cloud provider IP blocking, enhancing the security posture of FastAPI-based APIs.\n\n## üîë Key Takeaways\n\n- ‚úÖ Seamless FastAPI integration for easy setup and minimal performance impact.\n\n- ‚úÖ Multi-layered security with IP whitelisting/blacklisting, user agent filtering, and automatic IP banning.\n\n- ‚úÖ Powerful features such as penetration attempt detection and IP geolocation enhance security.\n\n- ‚úÖ Lightweight and efficient design ensures minimal overhead.\n\n- ‚úÖ Clear and concise documentation makes it easy to get started quickly and effectively\n\n\n## üìä Project Statistics\n- ‚≠ê Stars: 163\n- üç¥ Forks: 3\n- ‚ùó Open Issues: 0\n\n\n## üõ† Tech Stack\n- ‚úÖ Python\n\n\nHey fellow developers! Ever wished for a security superhero for your FastAPI projects?  Meet `fastapi-guard`, the knight in shining armor that protects your APIs from unwanted guests.  This isn't your grandma's security library; it's sleek, efficient, and surprisingly easy to use.  Think of it as a Swiss Army knife for API security, packed with features that make securing your FastAPI applications a breeze.\n\nSo, what does this magical library do?  It acts like a bouncer at the door of your API, carefully checking the credentials of every incoming request. This involves IP whitelisting and blacklisting‚Äîallowing only specific IP addresses or rejecting unwanted ones. But it goes further than simple IP checks.  It can filter out requests from suspicious user agents (like those pesky bots), automatically ban IPs that exhibit malicious behavior, and even detect and log potential penetration attempts. All this happens seamlessly, without you having to lift a finger (well, almost!).\n\nOne of the coolest features is its ability to integrate with IPInfo.io.  This means `fastapi-guard` can not only identify the IP address of a request but also its geographical location. This allows you to block requests from specific countries, adding another layer of protection against unwanted access. Imagine being able to block all requests coming from a particular region known for malicious activity‚Äîpretty powerful, right?\n\nBut what about performance?  You might be thinking, \"Adding all these security checks will slow down my API.\"  Think again! `fastapi-guard` is designed with performance in mind. It's lightweight and efficient, ensuring minimal impact on your application's speed.  Plus, the middleware integration with FastAPI makes it incredibly easy to implement without major architectural changes.\n\nThe setup is incredibly straightforward. You simply install it using pip (`pip install fastapi-guard`), configure a few settings (like your IPInfo token, whitelist/blacklist IPs, and other preferences), and integrate it into your FastAPI application. That's it! You've got a robust, multi-layered security system protecting your API.  The documentation is clear and concise, with plenty of examples to help you get started quickly.\n\nWhat are the key benefits? Time savings, improved workflow, and peace of mind. No more struggling with complex security implementations. No more worrying about vulnerabilities in your API.  `fastapi-guard` handles the heavy lifting, allowing you to focus on building awesome features instead of fighting security issues. It's a game-changer for developers who want to build secure and reliable FastAPI applications without sacrificing performance or ease of use.  Give it a try; you won't regret it!\n\n## üìö Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/rennf93/fastapi-guard)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
