    "contentMarkdown": "\n## 📝 Quick Summary: \nThis repository provides a Dockerized Python script to fetch health data from Garmin Connect and store it in an InfluxDB database. The data can then be visualized using Grafana, allowing users to track long-term health trends and create custom dashboards.\n\n## 🔑 Key Takeaways\n\n- ✅ Garmin Grafana provides a simple Dockerized solution to fetch and locally store all your comprehensive health metrics from Garmin Connect.\n\n- ✅ Achieve complete data autonomy and privacy by self-hosting your fitness data, avoiding reliance on third-party cloud services.\n\n- ✅ Utilize the power of InfluxDB and Grafana to build custom dashboards, combining metrics like HRV, Sleep Score, and Body Battery for deeper insights.\n\n- ✅ The project supports historical data backfilling and automatic syncing, making it a powerful 'set and forget' solution for long-term health tracking.\n\n\n## 📊 Project Statistics\n- ⭐ Stars: 2827\n- 🍴 Forks: 174\n- ❗ Open Issues: 20\n\n\n## 🛠 Tech Stack\n- ✅ Python\n\n\nAre you tired of being restricted by the default dashboards in your fitness tracker app? If you own a Garmin device, you know the data is incredibly valuable, but the visualization options can feel limiting, and crucially, you don't truly own that data locally. This is where \"Garmin Grafana\" steps in, offering a powerful, open-source solution to liberate your health metrics and turn them into actionable, fully customizable insights.\r\n\r\nThis project is essentially a self-hosted data pipeline wrapped neatly in a Docker container. Its primary job is to act as a secure, automated bridge between your Garmin Connect account and your private database. It automatically connects to the Garmin servers, fetches all your comprehensive health metrics—everything from granular heart rate data and detailed sleep patterns (including SpO2, Breathing Rate, and HRV) to stress levels and Body Battery scores—and pipes this information directly into an InfluxDB database running on your local machine or server.\r\n\r\nFor developers, the architecture is simple and robust: a Docker container handles the extraction and loading (ETL), InfluxDB provides the time-series storage, and Grafana offers the visualization layer. This modular setup means it's easy to deploy (even with helper scripts or Kubernetes charts) and easy to maintain. Once set up, the system is \"set and forget,\" automatically syncing new data shortly after every Garmin Connect upload, ensuring your local data store is always current.\r\n\r\nThe true magic happens when you connect Grafana to this local InfluxDB instance. Because the data is entirely under your control, you are free from the limitations of the official app. You can create completely custom dashboards, combining metrics that Garmin never thought to put together, tracking trends over months or years without data averaging, and zooming into specific workout timelines. Imagine building a dashboard that correlates your sleep score with your running pace over a six-month period, or analyzing your Body Battery recovery alongside your stress heatmap—that level of deep, personalized analysis is now easily accessible.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this project emphasizes local ownership and privacy. By hosting this stack yourself, you eliminate the risk of sharing sensitive health data with yet another third-party service. Plus, the ability to easily export this high-fidelity data as CSV files opens up pathways for advanced analysis, perhaps integrating it with Python scripts or local AI models to derive unique, personal insights about your health and performance. This is more than just a dashboard; it's true data autonomy for your wearable device, giving you full visualization freedom and deeper insights into your fitness journey.\n\n## 📚 Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/garmin-grafana)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
