It integrates seamlessly with React and TailwindCSS, enabling real-time modifications within the browser DOM. The tool aims to bridge the gap between design and development by allowing designers to customize the design, control the codebase, and publish changes without needing extensive coding knowledge.\n\n## üîë Key Takeaways\n\n- ‚úÖ Real-time visual code editing within the browser.\n\n- ‚úÖ Seamless integration with React and Tailwind CSS projects.\n\n- ‚úÖ Accelerated development workflow through reduced context switching.\n\n- ‚úÖ Enhanced collaboration with real-time chat and shared editing.\n\n- ‚úÖ Open-source and community-driven development for continuous improvement.\n\n\n## üìä Project Statistics\n- ‚≠ê Stars: 9155\n- üç¥ Forks: 550\n- ‚ùó Open Issues: 225\n\n\n## üõ† Tech Stack\n- ‚úÖ TypeScript\n\n\nOnlook: The Open-Source Cursor That's Revolutionizing Web Design\n\nEver wished you could directly manipulate a website's code while visually interacting with its elements? Onlook makes this dream a reality. It's an open-source cursor designed for designers, seamlessly integrating with any website or web app built using React and Tailwind CSS.  Imagine making live edits directly within your browser's DOM ‚Äì no more tedious back-and-forth between code editor and browser preview.  This isn't just about convenience; it's about a fundamental shift in how we approach web development.\n\nOnlook works by running locally as an Electron application.  Once installed, it connects to your React project.  Using a specially designed cursor, you can select any element on the webpage.  The magic happens when you right-click ‚Äì Onlook instantly highlights the corresponding code snippet in your preferred IDE, whether it's VS Code, WebStorm, or another editor of your choice.  It's like having a real-time, visual link between design and code.\n\nBut Onlook is more than just a visual code editor. It's a collaborative tool, allowing multiple designers to work simultaneously on the same project.  Think of it as Google Docs for your website's design. The built-in chat functionality allows seamless communication, making team collaboration smoother and more efficient.  Changes are instantly reflected in the browser, allowing for immediate feedback and iterative design improvements.\n\nThe benefits for developers are significant.  Onlook dramatically reduces the time spent switching between the browser and the code editor, accelerating the development process. The visual feedback loop ensures that design changes are instantly reflected, leading to fewer errors and quicker iterations.  This tool empowers designers to make more informed decisions, resulting in better user experiences and more robust web applications. The real-time collaboration features boost teamwork and enhance overall efficiency.\n\nOnlook's architecture is surprisingly straightforward. It leverages the power of React, Electron, Tailwind CSS, and Vite to provide a seamless and responsive user experience. The application is built with a focus on simplicity and ease of use, making it accessible to developers of all skill levels.  The project is open-source, encouraging community contributions and ensuring continued improvement.\n\nIn short, Onlook is a game-changer for web designers and developers.  It bridges the gap between visual design and code, making the development process faster, more efficient, and more collaborative.  If you're tired of the constant back-and-forth between design and code, Onlook is the solution you've been waiting for.\n\n## üìö Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/onlook-dev/onlook)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
