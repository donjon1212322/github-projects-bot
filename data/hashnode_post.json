It utilizes a template-based CLI tool to automate the testing process, allowing users to detect service presence, generate permutations for company-specific service discovery, and perform detailed misconfiguration checks.\n\n## 🔑 Key Takeaways\n\n- ✅ Automates security misconfiguration checks for various services and SaaS solutions.\n\n- ✅ Uses customizable templates for easy addition of new services and detection rules.\n\n- ✅ Offers flexible options: detect service presence only or perform full misconfiguration checks.\n\n- ✅ Simple installation and intuitive CLI makes it easy to use.\n\n- ✅ Open-source and actively maintained, ensuring up-to-date security checks and regular improvements.\n\n\n## 📊 Project Statistics\n- ⭐ Stars: 674\n- 🍴 Forks: 51\n- ❗ Open Issues: 1\n\n\n## 🛠 Tech Stack\n- ✅ Go\n\n\nHey fellow developers! Ever wished there was an easier way to hunt down those pesky security misconfigurations in your favorite services and SaaS solutions? Well, hold onto your hats, because Misconfig Mapper is here to save the day!  This open-source project, spearheaded by the awesome folks at Intigriti, is a game-changer for anyone serious about security.  Forget tedious manual checks; Misconfig Mapper automates the entire process, making security assessments faster and more efficient.\n\nAt its core, Misconfig Mapper is a command-line tool (CLI) built using Go.  Think of it as a super-powered detective for your cloud infrastructure. You feed it a company name or a list of potential targets, and it goes to work, intelligently identifying various services and then meticulously checking for known security misconfigurations. It uses a clever system of templates – essentially, pre-defined rules for detecting common vulnerabilities – to quickly scan and pinpoint potential problems. These templates are easily customizable and extendable, meaning you can easily add support for new services as they emerge.\n\nOne of the coolest things about Misconfig Mapper is its flexibility.  If you just want to see what services a company uses, you can do that.  If you want to go deeper and check for specific misconfigurations within those services, you can do that too.  The level of detail is completely up to you. It's like having a Swiss Army knife for security assessments – versatile and adaptable to various situations.\n\nThe installation process is straightforward. You can either download a pre-built binary or clone the repository and build it from source.  Once installed, using Misconfig Mapper is a breeze.  The command-line interface is intuitive and well-documented, making it accessible even to developers who aren't CLI experts. And the best part?  The project is constantly evolving, with regular updates and improvements ensuring that it stays ahead of the curve when it comes to detecting the latest security flaws.\n\nSo, why should you care?  Because Misconfig Mapper saves you time, effort, and potential headaches.  Instead of spending hours manually checking for misconfigurations, you can automate the process, freeing up your time to focus on other critical tasks. It helps you identify vulnerabilities before attackers do, reducing your organization's risk exposure and bolstering your overall security posture.  It's a must-have tool for any developer or security professional involved in cloud security or penetration testing.  Seriously, check it out – you won't regret it!\n\n## 📚 Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/intigriti/misconfig-mapper)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
