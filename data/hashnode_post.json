It supports MCP servers for accessing external tools and can expose agents as MCP tools for other clients to use.\n\n## 🔑 Key Takeaways\n\n- ✅ cagent is a powerful runtime for creating and managing collaborative, multi-agent AI systems.\n\n- ✅ Agents are configured declaratively using simple YAML files, simplifying complex workflow definition.\n\n- ✅ It supports deep integration with external tools via the MCP standard, enabling agents to perform real-world actions like web searching and file manipulation.\n\n- ✅ The framework allows complex agent teams to be exposed as reusable MCP tools, promoting modularity and integration.\n\n- ✅ Developers can drastically reduce boilerplate code and focus on defining specialized roles and capabilities.\n\n\n## 📊 Project Statistics\n- ⭐ Stars: 1667\n- 🍴 Forks: 182\n- ❗ Open Issues: 44\n\n\n## 🛠 Tech Stack\n- ✅ Go\n\n\nWe often find ourselves trying to cram every requirement into a single, massive prompt for an LLM, hoping it can juggle all the tasks, skills, and constraints simultaneously. The reality is, complex problems require specialized expertise. This is exactly the challenge that `cagent` solves by providing a powerful runtime for multi-agent systems. It lets you define a virtual team of AI experts where each member is assigned a specific role, specialized knowledge, and a clear instruction set. This approach shifts the focus from monolithic prompting to intelligent, collaborative workflow orchestration.\n\nDefining these specialized agents is surprisingly straightforward. Instead of writing complex Python code for communication logic, you define your entire team structure declaratively using simple YAML files. You specify the AI model each agent should use, a brief description of its purpose, and the core instructions that govern its behavior. For example, one agent might be the \"Code Reviewer,\" focused only on security and best practices, while another is the \"Documentation Writer,\" prioritizing clarity and user experience. This configuration method makes creating, sharing, and iterating on sophisticated AI workflows incredibly fast and accessible.\n\nWhere `cagent` truly shines is in its ability to equip these agents with external tools, moving them beyond mere text generation. It achieves this by deeply integrating support for the MCP (Multi-Container Protocol). Think of MCP as a standardized API gateway that allows your AI agents to seamlessly access real-world capabilities, such as performing live web searches via DuckDuckGo, reading and writing files to disk, or interacting with proprietary databases. You simply reference these tools in your agent's YAML configuration, and the `cagent` runtime handles the complex decision-making of when and how to invoke them, transforming a theoretical assistant into a practical, actionable problem-solver.\n\nFor developers, adopting `cagent` means significantly reducing the boilerplate traditionally associated with building sophisticated AI applications. It provides the execution environment, handling the communication protocols and tool-use logic, allowing you to focus entirely on defining the desired outcome and the team structure. Furthermore, the system is designed for modularity: you can take an entire, complex team defined in a YAML file and expose it as a single, reusable MCP tool. This means your advanced AI workflow can be easily consumed by other applications, other agent systems, or any MCP client, paving the way for truly composable and scalable AI services.\n\n## 📚 Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/docker/cagent)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
