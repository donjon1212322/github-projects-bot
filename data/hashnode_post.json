    "contentMarkdown": "\n## 📝 Quick Summary: \nPackemon is a TUI tool written in Go for generating and monitoring network packets. It allows users to craft and send custom packets to any network interface and simultaneously monitor network traffic, filtering and inspecting packets in detail. The tool supports Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n\n## 🔑 Key Takeaways\n\n- ✅ Packémon is a cross-platform TUI tool combining real-time packet generation and network monitoring into a single interface.\n\n- ✅ The Generator mode allows developers to craft and inject arbitrary packets, which is essential for testing and security analysis.\n\n- ✅ The Monitor mode provides deep, detailed inspection of captured packets, showing the full protocol stack breakdown.\n\n- ✅ It utilizes raw sockets and custom protocol stack implementation, offering unparalleled low-level control and visibility.\n\n- ✅ Packémon significantly streamlines network debugging workflows by integrating monitoring and testing capabilities in the terminal.\n\n\n## 📊 Project Statistics\n- ⭐ Stars: 280\n- 🍴 Forks: 2\n- ❗ Open Issues: 29\n\n\n## 🛠 Tech Stack\n- ✅ Go\n\n\nTired of context switching between complex GUIs and command-line tools just to inspect or inject network traffic? If you've ever needed to truly understand what's happening at the packet level—whether you’re debugging a tricky application layer issue or stress-testing a firewall—you know that powerful, accessible tools are essential. Dealing with raw network data often means juggling heavy applications or writing custom scripts, which slows down the crucial process of debugging and analysis.\r\n\r\nEnter Packémon, the \"Packet monster\" TUI (Terminal User Interface) tool that’s ready to capture and craft network packets right from your terminal. Forget clunky interfaces; Packémon brings low-level network manipulation into a beautiful, integrated console environment. It solves the perennial problem of needing precise control over network data without having to dive into complex scripting or relying on heavy GUI applications. Crucially, Packémon is built from the ground up, implementing protocol stacks from scratch and utilizing raw sockets, giving you unparalleled access to the network fabric.\r\n\r\nPackémon isn't just a passive listener; it's a dual-threat tool. Its first major function is the **Generator**. Imagine needing to test how a specific service, like a DNS server, responds to a malformed or custom query. With Packémon's Generator mode, you can easily craft packets with arbitrary input and send them out across any specified network interface. This capability is invaluable for penetration testing, protocol development, or simply verifying system behavior under unusual conditions. The ability to precisely control the bits flowing onto the wire is a superpower for network engineers and security researchers alike, offering a level of precision that standard utility tools often lack.\r\n\r\nThe second core function is the **Monitor**. This is your real-time network traffic viewer. Running alongside the Generator, the Monitor captures all incoming and outgoing packets on the selected interface (defaulting to `eth0`, but easily configurable via the `packemon interfaces` command). It presents the data in a clean, filterable list within the TUI. When a packet catches your eye—perhaps the response to the custom DNS query you just generated—you simply hit `Enter`. Packémon then drills down, displaying the full protocol stack details layer by layer, offering the kind of deep introspection you usually expect from tools like Wireshark, but all within the speed and efficiency of your terminal. You can filter the packet list instantly, making it easy to isolate the traffic you care about amidst the noise.\r\n\r\nSo, why should developers prioritize checking out Packémon? First, **efficiency**. It eliminates the need to jump between multiple tools for generation and monitoring. Everything is integrated into one fast, responsive TUI. Second, **deep debugging**. By building its protocol stacks from scratch and using raw sockets, Packémon gives you visibility into network interactions that higher-level tools often abstract away. This is crucial for solving those elusive timing or protocol compliance bugs. Third, **cross-platform reliability**. Whether you are working on Windows, macOS, or Linux, Packémon is designed to work seamlessly, ensuring consistency across your development environment. If you deal with networking, security analysis, or low-level systems programming, Packémon is a game-changer that puts the power of packet manipulation directly at your fingertips. Go capture your own packet monsters!\n\n## 📚 Learn More\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/ddddddO/packemon)\n\n---\n\nEnjoyed this project?
