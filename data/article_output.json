    "article": "WorkTUImer is a game-changer for developers who live in their terminal and hate context switching. At its heart, this project is a sleek, minimalist Terminal User Interface (TUI) built using the blazing speed of Rust and the ratatui framework. Its primary function is incredibly straightforward: to track your work time efficiently without ever needing to touch a mouse or leave your command line environment. It solves the perennial problem of friction associated with manual time logging.\n\nHow does it work? Imagine a digital punch card that is fully customizable via the keyboard. When you need to log a task, you simply use hotkeys to start a timer or enter the start and end times. The input process for time is particularly clever—it uses a PIN-input style, allowing you to log \"10:30\" with just four quick key presses. This focus on key efficiency drastically cuts down on the friction usually associated with logging tasks throughout the day. You can start, stop, or pause active timers, and the system automatically updates your work records with the exact time spent.\n\nOne of the coolest features is its intelligent task management. WorkTUImer automatically calculates durations and groups time blocks if you work on the same task across different sessions. Furthermore, it maintains a history, letting you quickly select previous task names from a picker, saving you from tedious retyping. For those dealing with issue trackers, it offers optional integration to detect and link to tickets (like JIRA or GitHub Issues) right from the task name, allowing you to jump to the ticket URL in your browser with a single keypress.\n\nFor developers, the benefit is pure productivity. Because it runs locally and saves data automatically as JSON files on a per-day basis, your data is secure and accessible, and the application is lightning fast. The comprehensive keyboard shortcuts, including Vim-style navigation (h/j/k/l), mean you can log, edit, delete, and navigate between days seamlessly. The inclusion of 50 levels of undo/redo history ensures that fixing mistakes is painless. If you value speed, privacy, and staying focused in your terminal, integrating WorkTUImer into your daily workflow will eliminate those annoying interruptions caused by switching to a separate web app just to log a few minutes of work. This is time tracking built by developers, for developers, maximizing efficiency where you already spend most of your time.",
