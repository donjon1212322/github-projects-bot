    "article": "Are you tired of jumping between half a dozen different applications just to manage your files? One client for FTP, another browser tab for Google Drive, a third tool for your S3 buckets, and maybe a command line for your SFTP server? This fragmentation is a massive drain on productivity, and frankly, it’s unnecessary in the modern development landscape. We need a single pane of glass for all our storage needs.\r\n\r\nEnter Filestash. This incredible open-source project is essentially a self-hosted, Dropbox-like file manager designed to be the universal connector for *all* your data sources. Whether your files are sitting on an old-school FTP server, a corporate SMB share, a cutting-edge S3 endpoint, or even within services like Git or Dropbox, Filestash brings them all into one beautiful, responsive web interface. Imagine accessing your entire digital estate from a single browser tab, seamlessly.\r\n\r\nThe magic behind Filestash lies in its highly modular architecture. The core application acts as a sleek frontend, and all the connectivity is handled through specialized plugins, or \"backends.\" This means if you want to connect to a new protocol, you just implement the required interface. This design choice makes Filestash incredibly robust and future-proof. It supports an astonishing array of protocols right out of the box, including SFTP, WebDAV, Git, NFS, and even services like Backblaze B2, Artifactory, and LDAP.\r\n\r\nWhy should developers be excited? Beyond the obvious benefit of centralization, Filestash is built for customization and automation. It features a powerful Workflow engine that lets you automate tasks across your connected storage. Need to process files after upload or integrate with external services? The extensibility is massive. Furthermore, the project includes robust API integration, specifically via its MCP (Message Control Protocol), which even supports LLM integration—opening up fascinating possibilities for intelligent file management and indexing.\r\n\r\nFor those concerned about user experience, Filestash hits the mark. It's fast, works perfectly on both desktop and mobile, and offers theme support that can mimic the look and feel of popular services like Google Drive or Dropbox. This familiarity drastically reduces the learning curve for any team members you onboard. Plus, it goes beyond the browser: it allows you to expose your unified file system via SFTP and S3 gateways, meaning you can use standard third-party tools (like desktop SFTP clients) to interact with data that might actually be sitting on a WebDAV server! This level of protocol translation and unification is a game-changer for complex infrastructure setups. Filestash isn't just a file browser; it's the ultimate file management platform designed to eliminate storage silos and streamline your workflow. It truly delivers on its vision to be the best file management platform ever made.",
