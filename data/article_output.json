    "article": "Are you tired of constantly juggling `docker ps`, `docker logs -f`, and then hunting down container IDs just to see what's happening in your local environment? We all know the pain of managing complex container setups solely through command-line incantations. That’s where DockrTUI swoops in to revolutionize your workflow. This project is a ridiculously fast, modern, and entirely keyboard-driven dashboard that puts your entire Docker universe right inside your terminal. It's designed to make managing containers feel less like typing spells in Bash and more like flying a starship.\n\nDockrTUI isn't just a pretty interface; it's built for efficiency. Under the hood, it’s powered by Rust and leverages the `ratatui` library, which means it’s lightning quick and incredibly stable. Think of it as turning your terminal into a high-performance cockpit for Docker. Instead of typing out long commands, you navigate using simple key presses like Tab, Enter, and arrow keys. This drastically cuts down the cognitive load and execution time required for routine tasks, allowing you to focus on development rather than infrastructure wrangling.\n\n The core functionality covers everything you need: Containers, Images, Networks, Volumes, and even integrated Compose projects. Switching between these views is instantaneous using the Tab key. Need to stop a runaway container? Select it and hit Enter. Want to check the logs? Press 'l'. It consolidates all those disparate CLI actions into a single, unified, and interactive view, making inspection and quick actions intuitive and immediate.\n\nOne of the standout features that makes DockrTUI a must-have is the built-in shell. Instead of fumbling with `docker exec -it [container] /bin/bash`, you can simply select a running container and hit 'b'. This drops you directly into an interactive shell right within the TUI interface, complete with command history and tab autocompletion. It feels seamless and saves precious seconds every time you need to debug or inspect a running service, maintaining your persistent working directory throughout the session.\n\nFor developers working with microservices or complex Compose environments, the dedicated Compose tab is a game-changer. DockrTUI automatically detects your Compose files, allowing you to run `up`, `down`, or view logs for the entire project without ever leaving the dashboard. Furthermore, the project handles Docker socket detection intelligently, working flawlessly with Docker Desktop, rootless setups, and even Podman (via Docker API compatibility), ensuring compatibility across various environments right out of the box. If you value speed, keyboard shortcuts, and a clean, consolidated view of your containerized world, ditch the bash scripts and give DockrTUI a spin. It genuinely transforms Docker management from a chore into a fluid, enjoyable experience.",
