That's why I'm super excited to share a fantastic GitHub project with you: Domain Scanner. This tool is a game-changer for anyone who needs to find available domain names quickly and efficiently. Forget endless manual searches; this tool automates the process and makes it a breeze.\n\nDomain Scanner is a powerful domain name availability checker written in Go.  What sets it apart is its comprehensive approach.  It doesn't just check one or two things; it uses multiple methods to verify availability.  Think of it like this: you're not just asking one person if a domain is free; you're asking several authoritative sources (DNS records, WHOIS information, SSL certificates) to confirm. This multi-layered approach ensures more accurate results and minimizes false positives.\n\nThe architecture is surprisingly elegant.  It's designed for speed and efficiency using Go's concurrency features. You can configure the number of 'workers' – essentially, the number of simultaneous checks the tool can perform. This means you can scan through hundreds or even thousands of potential domains in a fraction of the time it would take manually.  Plus, it handles errors gracefully with automatic retries, ensuring that even temporary network hiccups won't stop your search.\n\nBut the real magic is in the flexibility. You can define the length of the domain names you're looking for, specify the top-level domain (like '.com', '.org', '.net'), and even use regular expressions to filter results based on specific patterns.  Need only alphanumeric domains?  No problem. Want to exclude names containing certain characters?  Domain Scanner makes it easy. The tool provides detailed results, indicating precisely why a domain might be unavailable (e.g., DNS records exist, WHOIS data shows it's registered, etc.). This granular level of detail is invaluable for making informed decisions.\n\nThe best part?  It outputs the results to separate files for available and registered domains, neatly organized and ready for further analysis.  Imagine saving hours of tedious work – that's the power of Domain Scanner. The project also includes a well-designed web interface, accessible at zli.li, offering a user-friendly alternative to the command-line tool. This web version provides a convenient way to quickly check domain availability without needing to install or run any software. Overall, this project is an outstanding example of efficient, well-documented, and user-friendly software development. It's a must-have tool for any developer or business owner who values their time and needs to find available domain names quickly and efficiently.",
