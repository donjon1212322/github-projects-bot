FlatNotes provides a robust RESTful API for integration with other applications.  And if security is a concern, FlatNotes offers multiple authentication options, including 2FA, keeping your notes safe and sound.  The best part?  It's mobile-responsive, so you can access your notes from anywhere, anytime.\n\nBut what makes FlatNotes truly stand out is its ease of setup.  Forget tedious installations and configurations. You can get started quickly using PikaPods for a hosted solution. Or, if you prefer, you can self-host FlatNotes using Docker in minutes.
