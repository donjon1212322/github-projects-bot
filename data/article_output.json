    "article": "We all spend hours researching online, pulling documentation, or saving interesting articles. But when you try to copy and paste web content, you usually end up with a messy disaster—broken styles, stray scripts, and huge chunks of irrelevant navigation. Cleaning that up manually is a huge time sink. This is exactly where cpdown steps in, offering a simple, elegant solution to web content extraction.\n\nThink of cpdown as your browser's specialized cleaning crew. It's a lightweight browser extension for Chrome and Firefox designed to strip away all the digital noise and leave you with just the pure, readable text, instantly converted into Markdown format. When you click the cpdown icon, it doesn't just grab everything; it intelligently focuses on the main article body. It achieves this magic by leveraging powerful tools like Defuddle and Mozilla's Readability algorithms, which are excellent at determining what constitutes the \"main content\" of a page, ensuring you capture the essence without the fluff.\n\nFor developers, the time-saving potential is huge. Need to quickly document a complex configuration guide found on a blog? One click, and you have perfectly formatted Markdown ready for your README or internal wiki. The extension automatically removes unnecessary HTML elements like scripts, styles, and iframes, guaranteeing a clean output every single time. This drastically speeds up documentation and note-taking workflows.\n\nBeyond general articles, cpdown has a killer feature: it can accurately extract and clean up subtitles from YouTube videos, turning spoken content into easily searchable text notes. This is a game-changer for learning from video tutorials or quickly referencing key points without scrubbing through a timeline. It transforms passive viewing into active, structured knowledge capture.\n\nA particularly modern and useful benefit is the built-in token counter. If you frequently use tools like ChatGPT or other Large Language Models (LLMs) for summarization or analysis, knowing the token count before pasting is incredibly valuable for managing context windows and estimating costs. Furthermore, cpdown is highly customizable. You can toggle between using Defuddle or Readability depending on which gives you better results for a specific site, choose whether to wrap the output in triple backticks for code block compatibility, and even enable fun confetti animations upon success. It’s all about getting clean, structured data effortlessly, making your workflow smoother and your research notes immaculate.",
