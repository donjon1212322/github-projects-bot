Ghostty also packs a punch in terms of features.  We're talking multi-window support, tabbed browsing, customizable panes â€“ all the things you'd expect from a modern terminal, and more.  This level of customization allows you to tailor your workspace to perfectly match your workflow. Beyond the standard features, Ghostty is designed to be extensible. The developers are pushing the boundaries of what's possible with a terminal emulator, exposing modern features that enable CLI tool developers to build even more interactive and powerful applications. This means a more vibrant and innovative CLI ecosystem in the years to come.  For developers, the benefits are clear: increased productivity, a more enjoyable development experience, and access to cutting-edge features that enhance your command-line interactions.  Ghostty is not just a replacement for your current terminal; it's an upgrade.  It's a tool that empowers you to work smarter, not harder.  Give it a try and experience the difference a truly modern terminal emulator can make.  The project is actively developed and the community is growing, so you can expect continued improvements and new features in the future.",
