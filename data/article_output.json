Tired of juggling different apps and struggling to keep track of what you've read and what's next on your list? Then get ready to meet BookLore, the self-hosted web application that's about to revolutionize how you interact with your personal library!  Imagine a beautifully designed interface that allows you to effortlessly organize your books, track your reading progress, and even read directly within the app. That's the promise of BookLore.\n\nBookLore isn't just a simple ebook reader; it's a comprehensive book management system.  It lets you create libraries and shelves, allowing you to categorize your books in any way you see fit – by genre, author, date read, or even by your own personal system.  Need to find that specific thriller you started last month? No problem! BookLore's intuitive search and filtering options make finding your books a breeze.  But the magic doesn't stop there. BookLore leverages the power of several APIs (Goodreads, Amazon, Google Books, and more) to automatically fetch metadata for your books, saving you countless hours of manual data entry.  Think cover art, author information, publication details – all automatically populated!  And if the automatic metadata isn't quite perfect, you can easily fine-tune it with BookLore's advanced editor.\n\nCollaboration is key, and BookLore understands this.  It offers multi-user support with permission-based access control.  Share your library with family, friends, or even colleagues – each user can have their own profile and reading lists, while you maintain control over who can access and modify your collection.  This is especially useful for families or book clubs that want to share their library efficiently. \n\nBeyond organization, BookLore also boasts a built-in reader that supports PDFs, ePub, and CBX formats.  Enjoy a smooth, distraction-free reading experience directly in your browser, with customizable themes and settings to create the perfect reading environment.  You can even integrate BookLore with your favorite reading apps using OPDS 1.2 support, ensuring seamless downloads and a consistent experience across all your devices.  Want to add dozens of books at once?  Simply drop them into BookLore's designated 'BookDrop' folder, and the app will automatically scan, organize, and fetch metadata for each book – a true time-saver!  Need to share a book with a friend? Just email it directly from within the app!\n\nBut the best part? BookLore is open-source and self-hosted!  This means you have complete control over your data and its security. No third-party servers, no subscription fees – just your books, your way.  And with active development and regular updates, you can rest assured that BookLore will continue to evolve and improve.  It is mobile-optimized, meaning you can manage your library from anywhere, anytime.\n\nIn short, BookLore is a game-changer for anyone who values their personal library. It's a powerful, flexible, and user-friendly tool that simplifies book organization, enhances reading experiences, and promotes collaboration.  Give it a try, and get ready to rediscover the joy of reading!",
