    "article": "Tired of clunky presentation software?  Wish you could create presentations directly from your terminal, using a format you already know and love? Then get ready to meet Presenterm! This amazing GitHub project lets you build presentations in simple Markdown, then run them directly from your terminal.  No more PowerPoint hassles! \n\nPresenterm's genius lies in its simplicity. You write your presentation as a Markdown file – that's it.  Headings become slides, images and GIFs are easily embedded, and you can even include code blocks with syntax highlighting.  It's incredibly intuitive, and you probably already know Markdown if you're a developer. \n\nBut it's not just plain text. Presenterm supports a surprising number of advanced features. You can customize the look and feel with themes (several built-in ones are available!), adjust font sizes, create column layouts, and even render Mermaid diagrams and LaTeX formulas directly within your slides.  Imagine seamlessly integrating charts and complex equations into your terminal presentations! \n\nFor developers, the benefits are huge.  First, the workflow is incredibly streamlined.  No more switching between apps – you create and present all within your terminal. Second, the use of Markdown makes content creation quick and easy. Third, the support for code highlighting and execution makes it perfect for technical presentations, allowing you to demonstrate code snippets directly within your presentation.  Finally, Presenterm lets you export your presentation as a PDF, useful for sharing with colleagues or clients who might not have the same terminal setup. \n\nBeyond the core features, Presenterm also provides speaker notes, custom key bindings for navigation, and even a hot-reload feature for rapid development.  This means that every time you save changes to your Markdown file, the presentation automatically updates!  It's like having a live, interactive presentation editor right in your terminal.\n\nOverall, Presenterm is a game-changer for anyone who gives technical presentations. Its blend of simplicity, power, and developer-centric features makes it a must-have tool.  Say goodbye to PowerPoint and hello to the future of terminal presentations!",
