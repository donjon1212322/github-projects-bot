    "title": "Ditch Context Switching: Wave Terminal Unifies Your CLI, Browser, and AI",
    "article": "We all know the pain: running a command, hitting an error, opening the browser for documentation, jumping to a separate editor to check a remote config file, and maybe pasting the error into an AI tool. Developers spend half their time managing this context switching chaos. Wave Terminal is here to solve that by fundamentally rethinking what a terminal can be.\n\nWave integrates all the tools you constantly juggle—the command line, graphical file previewers, a web browser, and a powerful AI assistant—into one unified, customizable workspace. It moves beyond the traditional text-only interface by introducing flexible \"blocks.\" You can drag and drop these blocks to organize your session, combining standard shell inputs with things like a built-in code editor or a documentation widget.\n\nHow does this block system enhance your workflow? Imagine running a complex database migration in one terminal block while simultaneously editing the schema file in an adjacent, modern editor block—even if that file is on a remote server accessible via SSH. You can then use another block to quickly preview a generated PDF report or check a Markdown README file, all without ever leaving the Wave application. This rich file preview system works flawlessly for remote files, making file management incredibly visual and secure.\n\nPerhaps the most transformative feature is Wave AI. This isn't just a generic chatbot; it's deeply context-aware. It has access to your workspace, meaning it can read the scrollback history of your terminal output, analyze active widgets, and even perform file operations (only with your explicit approval, of course). This turns debugging into a conversation. Instead of copying logs, you simply ask the AI, \"What caused this error?\" and it responds based on the immediate context of your session.\n\nBeyond the visuals and AI, Wave simplifies the complexities of multi-host development. It features secure secret storage using native system backends, allowing you to safely store API keys and credentials and access them across all your SSH sessions. Furthermore, the powerful `wsh` command system lets you manage your entire environment from the CLI, enabling seamless file synchronization between local machines, remote hosts, and even S3 buckets. Wave Terminal drastically reduces mental overhead, allowing you to focus on coding, not context management.",
