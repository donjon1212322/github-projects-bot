It provides pre-designed spiking neuron models that can be seamlessly integrated into PyTorch workflows, enabling GPU-accelerated computation for SNNs. The library also supports interoperability with other SNN frameworks through NIR, and offers tools for spike generation, visualization, and functional operations.\n<br>\nðŸ”— <b>Links:</b>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"https://github.com/jeshraghian/snntorch?embed=0\">View Project</a>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?embed=0\">Homepage</a>\n================\n<a href='https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source'>ðŸ”“ Open Source</a>",
