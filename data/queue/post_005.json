It supports filtering events based on tables and actions, and allows topic mapping for custom routing. This enables the implementation of Event-Driven Architecture with transactional messaging to maintain data consistency across microservices.\n<br>\nðŸ”— <b>Links:</b>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"https://github.com/ihippik/wal-listener?embed=0\">View Project</a>\n================\n<a href='https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source'>ðŸ”“ Open Source</a>",
