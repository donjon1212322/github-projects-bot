It creates a virtual environment by cloning the address space of a suspended process, allowing for the execution and monitoring of applications in a virtualized setting. The emulator forwards syscalls to the host OS and provides a framework for implementing custom syscall hooks.\n<br>\nðŸ”— <b>Links:</b>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"https://github.com/x86matthew/WinVisor?embed=0\">View Project</a>\n================\n<a href='https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source'>ðŸ”“ Open Source</a>",
