It takes a binary as input, iteratively splits it, and isolates the exact byte sequences that are flagged, printing these bytes to the screen. This functionality assists in understanding and evading Defender's detection mechanisms during payload development and security research.\n<br>\nðŸ”— <b>Links:</b>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"https://github.com/matterpreter/DefenderCheck?embed=0\">View Project</a>\n================\n<a href='https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source'>ðŸ”“ Open Source</a>",
