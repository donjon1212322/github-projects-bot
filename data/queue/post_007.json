It uses color-coded underlines to represent different states of variables and integrates with various editors via VSCode extension, Neovim plugin, Emacs package, or a custom LSP client.  The tool analyzes Rust source code and provides visualizations upon hovering over variables or function calls.\n<br>\nðŸ”— <b>Links:</b>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"https://github.com/cordx56/rustowl?embed=0\">View Project</a>\n================\n<a href='https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source'>ðŸ”“ Open Source</a>",
