This allows for efficient similarity searches in large datasets where documents are represented by multiple vectors, preserving the relationships between them.\n<br>\nðŸ”— <b>Links:</b>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"https://github.com/sigridjineth/muvera-py?embed=0\">View Project</a>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"https://github.com/google/graph-mining/tree/main/sketching/point_cloud?embed=0\">Homepage</a>\n================\n<a href='https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source'>ðŸ”“ Open Source</a>",
