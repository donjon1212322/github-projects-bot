This allows developers to mathematically prove the correctness of their Rust programs, ensuring they meet their specifications for all possible inputs. The tool includes features for translation, refinement, and specification, ultimately aiming to reduce bugs and vulnerabilities to zero.\n<br>\nðŸ”— <b>Links:</b>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"https://github.com/formal-land/coq-of-rust?embed=0\">View Project</a>\n================\n<a href='https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source'>ðŸ”“ Open Source</a>",
