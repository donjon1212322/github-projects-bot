It uses a video diffusion model with several key modules to ensure ID consistency, including a Face Encoder and ID Adapter.  The model also incorporates HJB equation-based optimization for enhanced face quality during inference.\n<br>\nðŸ”— <b>Links:</b>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"https://github.com/Francis-Rings/StableAnimator?embed=0\">View Project</a>\n================\n<a href='https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source'>ðŸ”“ Open Source</a>",
