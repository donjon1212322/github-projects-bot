It offers faster performance, data compression, and cross-language compatibility, making it particularly suitable for storing large NumPy arrays.\n<br>\nðŸ”— <b>Links:</b>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"https://github.com/telegraphic/hickle?embed=0\">View Project</a>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"http://telegraphic.github.io/hickle/?embed=0\">Homepage</a>\n================\n<a href='https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source'>ðŸ”“ Open Source</a>",
