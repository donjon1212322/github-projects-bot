It achieves this by rewriting resource-intensive components in C++, specifically in-memory block construction and Write-Ahead Log (WAL) management. Prom++ is a drop-in replacement for Prometheus, ensuring effortless migration and full compatibility with existing configurations and data.\n<br>\nðŸ”— <b>Links:</b>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"https://github.com/deckhouse/prompp?embed=0\">View Project</a>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"https://deckhouse.ru/products/prompp/?embed=0\">Homepage</a>\n================\n<a href='https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source'>ðŸ”“ Open Source</a>",
