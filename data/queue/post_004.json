It leverages cloud-hypervisor and KVM for virtualization, openvswitch for networking, and uses TOML files for template-based VM configuration. This approach enables fast provisioning and management of VMs from a single interface.\n<br>\nðŸ”— <b>Links:</b>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"https://github.com/pipelight/virshle?embed=0\">View Project</a>\n================\n<a href='https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source'>ðŸ”“ Open Source</a>",
