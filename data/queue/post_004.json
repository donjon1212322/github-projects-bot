It offers a scale-free, locally interacting network of neurons that achieves Transformer-like performance while maintaining full interpretability and theoretical grounding in neural dynamics.\n<br>\n🔗 <b>Links:</b>\n• <a href=\"https://github.com/pathwaycom/bdh?embed=0\">View Project</a>\n================\n<a href='https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source'>🔓 Open Source</a>",
