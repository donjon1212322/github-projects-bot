It is suitable for scenarios where the knowledge base fits within the model's context window, offering a simplified design and improved reliability compared to traditional RAG.\n<br>\nðŸ”— <b>Links:</b>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"https://github.com/hhhuang/CAG?embed=0\">View Project</a>\n================\n<a href='https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source'>ðŸ”“ Open Source</a>",
