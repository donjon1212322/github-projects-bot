It collects SSID probes, ARPs, and MDNS packets, extracts BSSIDs and SSIDs, and queries Apple's WiFi location service and wigle.net to obtain GPS coordinates, providing a web interface for data analysis and visualization.\n<br>\nðŸ”— <b>Links:</b>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"https://github.com/hubert3/iSniff-GPS?embed=0\">View Project</a>\n================\n<a href='https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source'>ðŸ”“ Open Source</a>",
