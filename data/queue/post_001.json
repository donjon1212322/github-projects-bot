It renders the sorting process as a bar graph in the terminal and plays a tone for each element access or modification, with the pitch corresponding to the element's value. It also supports sorting ASCII/Unicode art piped via stdin, offering an image mode.\n<br>\nðŸ”— <b>Links:</b>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"https://github.com/sahaj-b/sound-of-sort?embed=0\">View Project</a>\n================\n<a href='https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source'>ðŸ”“ Open Source</a>",
