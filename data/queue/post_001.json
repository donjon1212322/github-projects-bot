While not yet incremental, it offers speed improvements over other linkers for initial builds.  It supports various output formats and has been tested with many crates from crates.io.\n<br>\nðŸ”— <b>Links:</b>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"https://github.com/davidlattimore/wild?embed=0\">View Project</a>\n================\n<a href='https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source'>ðŸ”“ Open Source</a>",
