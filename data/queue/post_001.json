It leverages WASM sandboxing to provide a secure environment for applications. The OS features a graphical interface, network stack, UI toolkit, and embedded applications, primarily using VirtIO drivers and avoiding traditional OS components like bootloaders and interrupts for simplicity.\n<br>\nðŸ”— <b>Links:</b>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"https://github.com/Askannz/munal-os?embed=0\">View Project</a>\n================\n<a href='https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source'>ðŸ”“ Open Source</a>",
