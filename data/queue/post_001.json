It leverages ElevenLabs for conversational AI and ggwave for data transmission over sound, offering a unique demonstration of AI-to-AI communication switching mechanisms.\n<br>\nðŸ”— <b>Links:</b>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"https://github.com/PennyroyalTea/gibberlink?embed=0\">View Project</a>\n================\n<a href='https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source'>ðŸ”“ Open Source</a>",
