It uniquely encodes the encrypted data as cat and dog sounds, providing a playful and less conspicuous way to transmit sensitive information. The tool offers a command-line interface for key management, encryption, and decryption, making cryptography more approachable and fun.\n<br>\nðŸ”— <b>Links:</b>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"https://github.com/vxfemboy/purrcrypt?embed=0\">View Project</a>\n================\n<a href='https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source'>ðŸ”“ Open Source</a>",
