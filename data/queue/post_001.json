It stores a file (typically a cryptographic key) and only exposes it as a USB drive after successful presence verification, usually via Bluetooth LE. The device automatically relocks after a timeout or when the user's presence is no longer detected, providing an air-gap security benefit.\n<br>\nðŸ”— <b>Links:</b>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"https://github.com/juergenpabel/circuitpython-peckus?embed=0\">View Project</a>\n================\n<a href='https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source'>ðŸ”“ Open Source</a>",
