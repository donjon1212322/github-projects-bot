It replaces the traditional password screen with a custom PokÃ©mon game, where the user must solve a puzzle to unlock their session. The project leverages the ext-session-lock-v1 protocol for secure locking and involves patching both a Gameboy emulator and a PokÃ©mon game to achieve this functionality.\n<br>\nðŸ”— <b>Links:</b>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"https://github.com/AdoPi/wlgblock?embed=0\">View Project</a>\n================\n<a href='https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source'>ðŸ”“ Open Source</a>",
