It functions like a compiler for interpreted programs, lifting ELF objects into an intermediate representation and lowering them back, enabling the merging of dynamic linkers and dependencies into a single executable.\n<br>\n🔗 <b>Links:</b>\n• <a href=\"https://github.com/whitequark/superlinker?embed=0\">View Project</a>\n================\n<a href='https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source'>🔓 Open Source</a>",
