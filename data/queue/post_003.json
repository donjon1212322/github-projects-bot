It takes various inputs like images, calibration data, and poses to directly regress the 3D geometry of a scene. The model supports multiple 3D reconstruction tasks, including multi-image structure from motion, multi-view stereo, and monocular depth estimation.\n<br>\nðŸ”— <b>Links:</b>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"https://github.com/facebookresearch/map-anything?embed=0\">View Project</a>\n================\n<a href='https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source'>ðŸ”“ Open Source</a>",
