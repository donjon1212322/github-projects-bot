This enables users to leverage Git's powerful features like diffing, blame, and log to analyze and track changes within container images. The primary use case is layer diffing, allowing engineers to easily identify changes between layers for troubleshooting and understanding image evolution.\n<br>\nðŸ”— <b>Links:</b>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"https://github.com/Virviil/oci2git?embed=0\">View Project</a>\n================\n<a href='https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source'>ðŸ”“ Open Source</a>",
