It analyzes callstacks for suspicious memory regions, module stomping, abnormal intermodular calls, and return address spoofing. The tool also enumerates timers and their callbacks to detect timer-based sleepmasks, providing a comprehensive approach to detecting sleeping beacons.\n<br>\nðŸ”— <b>Links:</b>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"https://github.com/thefLink/Hunt-Sleeping-Beacons?embed=0\">View Project</a>\n================\n<a href='https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source'>ðŸ”“ Open Source</a>",
