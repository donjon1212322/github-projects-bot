It allows splitting a secret image into multiple shares, which individually appear as random noise but reveal the original image when combined. The toolkit supports both web-based and script-based execution and is designed to be easily extended with new cryptographic schemes.\n<br>\nðŸ”— <b>Links:</b>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"https://github.com/coduri/VisualCrypto?embed=0\">View Project</a>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"https://coduri.github.io/VisualCrypto/?embed=0\">Homepage</a>\n================\n<a href='https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source'>ðŸ”“ Open Source</a>",
