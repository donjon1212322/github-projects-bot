It uniquely combines AI and compiler technologies, resulting in features like non-reproducible builds and mandatory internet access. The project also claims to be a universal compiler, capable of significantly speeding up code written in other languages like Python.\n<br>\nðŸ”— <b>Links:</b>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"https://github.com/vytskalt/pseudoc?embed=0\">View Project</a>\n================\n<a href='https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source'>ðŸ”“ Open Source</a>",
