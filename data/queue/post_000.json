It leverages Flux diffusion models for image outpainting and inpainting, 3D Gaussian Splatting for efficient scene representation, and Rerun for real-time visualization. The framework uses a two-stage pipeline involving coarse 3D scaffold construction and multi-view consistency sampling to generate high-quality novel views.\n<br>\nðŸ”— <b>Links:</b>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"https://github.com/rerun-io/vistadream?embed=0\">View Project</a>\n================\n<a href='https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source'>ðŸ”“ Open Source</a>",
