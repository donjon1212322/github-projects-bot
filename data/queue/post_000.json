It achieves this by running a server process with ADB or root permissions, allowing apps to bypass certain permission restrictions and perform privileged operations without direct root access. This approach offers a more reliable and flexible alternative to traditional methods that involve executing commands in a su shell.\n<br>\nðŸ”— <b>Links:</b>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku?embed=0\">View Project</a>\n================\n<a href='https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source'>ðŸ”“ Open Source</a>",
