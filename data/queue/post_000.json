It allows for inference in a single stage using one model and can be trained quickly using a single GPU. The model aims to reconstruct humans and their surrounding environment in 4D (3D space over time).\n<br>\nðŸ”— <b>Links:</b>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"https://github.com/fanegg/Human3R?embed=0\">View Project</a>\nâ€¢ <a href=\"https://fanegg.github.io/Human3R/?embed=0\">Homepage</a>\n================\n<a href='https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source'>ðŸ”“ Open Source</a>",
