The detective uses a magnifying glass (Chrome DevTools) to trace the flow of data, identifying bottlenecks and anomalies. Small screens display snippets of code and performance metrics, subtly connecting the scene to software. The setting is a dimly lit, futuristic laboratory with glowing cables and holographic displays. The image should be in a 3D isometric illustration style with rich details and a dark blue and purple color scheme."
