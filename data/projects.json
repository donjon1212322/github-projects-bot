Raw data streams flow into the workbench as input, and the resulting AI agent stands ready as the output, emitting a soft blue light. The scene is a clean, minimalist workshop, emphasizing the visual, low-code nature of the construction process. Subtle UI elements float near the connections, showing configuration settings. 3D isometric illustration, clean lines, vibrant blue and white color scheme, highly conceptual and focused composition."
