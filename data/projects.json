The bird carries glowing packets of data, ensuring secure communication. One castle displays a WhatsApp logo subtly on its gate, while the other shows a generic web interface. Small UI elements float around the bird, displaying message status and encryption keys. The scene is set in a vibrant, stylized landscape with a clear sky. The composition is clean and focused with a bright color scheme. The image should be in a flat design style with clear iconography and subtle digital enhancements."
