As the librarian reads, the text from the books magically transforms into structured data displayed on a nearby holographic screen. Subtle tech elements like glowing data streams and UI elements showing SQL queries are visible. The scene is set in a warmly lit, classic library with modern holographic interfaces. The composition is focused and clear, with a rich color scheme. The image should be in a 3D isometric illustration style with vibrant colors and rich details."
