The terminal displays encrypted text, with digital locks and keys floating around the screen. The messenger stands in a dimly lit, secure vault, with code snippets subtly etched onto the stone walls. The scene emphasizes privacy and secure communication. The repository name, 'Enchat,' is subtly displayed on a banner in the background. The image should be in a digital painting style with dramatic lighting and a focus on clear, understandable visuals."
