As they look, detailed information, star ratings, and comparison charts materialize in the air around the box, floating towards the viewer. Subtle digital particles and faint code snippets drift in the background, hinting at the underlying technology. The scene is set in a cozy, dimly lit study, evoking a sense of discovery and knowledge. The overall style is a 3D isometric illustration with a warm, inviting color palette."
