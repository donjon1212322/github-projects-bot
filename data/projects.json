The detective is surrounded by floating image files, each emitting faint trails of metadata. A holographic OpenStreetMap projection displays the pinpointed location. Subtle UI elements show ExifLooter's interface, extracting data. The scene is set in a dimly lit, high-tech office with glowing screens. The image should be in a detailed digital painting style with a focus on clarity and precision."
