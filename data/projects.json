In the background, a subtle network of interconnected nodes suggests connectivity and the browser interface. The overall mood is bright, clean, and futuristic, with a focus on ease of use and direct digital connection. The style should be a clean, 3D isometric illustration with vibrant, tech-inspired colors."
