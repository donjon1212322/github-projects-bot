The player character, represented by a small, determined robot, is carefully navigating a grid of minefield squares. Some squares are revealed, showing numbers indicating adjacent mines, while others remain hidden, with a few ominous red 'mine' icons peeking out. Small, glowing data streams flow from the terminal screen, subtly suggesting the underlying code and game logic. The overall mood is one of focused, digital puzzle-solving. The art style should be a clean, 3D isometric illustration with a neon-infused color palette, emphasizing the digital nature of the game and the terminal interface."
