The corkboard displays a timeline with highlighted activity periods, a heatmap of website visits, and extracted personal details. Subtle glowing lines connect related pieces of information, symbolizing the analysis process. The repository name 'ForensiX' is subtly etched onto the detective's briefcase. The scene is set in a dimly lit, high-tech investigation room, rendered in a 3D isometric illustration style with a cool, analytical color palette and glowing data elements."
