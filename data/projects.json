The map expands beyond the tablet screen, revealing a vibrant, evolving civilization with cities, resources, and strategic landscapes. The cartographer uses a stylus to add new features and refine existing ones, while subtle UI elements and code snippets float around the scene, representing the game's moddability. The scene is set in a bright, airy studio with a blend of antique maps and futuristic displays. The image should be in a detailed digital painting style with clear outlines and a warm color scheme."
