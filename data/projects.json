        "cover_image_prompt": "A master architect overseeing the construction of a grand city, where each building represents a different application or system. The architect uses modular blueprints (Symfony components) to assemble the city's infrastructure efficiently and reliably. Some buildings are sleek and modern, while others are robust and long-lasting (LTS versions). Digital streams of data flow between the buildings, showcasing the framework's ability to handle complex interactions. Small screens display code snippets and architectural diagrams. The scene is set in a bright, futuristic cityscape with a blue and white color scheme. The image should be in 3D isometric illustration style with clean lines and clear details."

The gardener uses specialized tools (Argo Rollouts) to precisely control the watering and sunlight exposure of different plant varieties (application versions). Some plants are thriving (stable versions), while others are undergoing controlled growth experiments (canary deployments). Digital overlays show metrics and traffic flow visualizations around the garden. The scene is set in a futuristic greenhouse with glowing data streams. The image should be in a 3D isometric illustration style with bright, cheerful colors and clear details."
