The chef uses a special spatula labeled 'swifter' to flip the data in the pans, ensuring each element is cooked to perfection with optimal speed. Digital readouts on the stove display performance metrics and optimization algorithms. The kitchen is modern and sleek, with subtle code snippets projected onto the walls. The image should be in a vibrant, 3D isometric illustration style with clear details and a focus on efficiency and speed."
