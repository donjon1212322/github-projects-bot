        "readme_summary": "Hickle is a Python library that serves as a drop-in replacement for the pickle module, but instead of serializing to pickle files, it dumps data into HDF5 files. It offers faster performance, data compression, and cross-language compatibility, making it particularly suitable for storing large NumPy arrays.",
        "key_features": [
            "HDF5-based pickle replacement",
            "Faster than pickle and cPickle",
            "Data compression (LZF/GZIP)",
            "Stores data in HDF5 format",
            "Drop-in replacement for pickle"
        ],
        "primary_use_case": "Storing Python variables, especially large NumPy arrays, in HDF5 files for faster read/write and cross-language compatibility.",

        "cover_image_prompt": "Imagine a skilled librarian meticulously organizing a vast collection of books. Instead of traditional shelves, the books are stored within a glowing, crystalline structure representing HDF5. The librarian carefully places Python objects (represented as uniquely shaped artifacts) into the structure, compressing them with a magical tool. A holographic display shows the Python code interacting with the HDF5 structure. The scene is bathed in soft, ethereal light, emphasizing the efficiency and organization. The image should be in a 3D isometric illustration style with vibrant colors and intricate details, subtly incorporating the word 'Hickle' into the librarian's desk."
