The shield glows with Lua script patterns, deflecting the DDoS attack. The gatekeeper examines each arrow, allowing only legitimate traffic to pass through the server's entrance. Small screens display real-time threat analysis and IP whitelists. The scene is set in a futuristic data center with blue and green lighting. The image should be in a digital painting style with clean lines and clear details, emphasizing security and protection."
