The architect points to a blueprint written in plain English, and the robots interpret the instructions to build web and Android interfaces, test functionalities, and automate tasks. The building is sleek and modern, with glowing UI elements subtly integrated into the design. Small screens display code snippets and test results. The scene is set in a bright, futuristic workshop with a focus on precision and efficiency. The image should be in a 3D isometric illustration style with clean lines, vibrant colors, and a focus on clarity."
