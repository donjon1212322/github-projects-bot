Instead of paint, they are using a glowing cursor to 'draw' intricate shapes and flowcharts using only characters like '|', '-', '+', and letters. The 'canvas' is a large, transparent screen displaying the ASCII art as it's being created. Subtle digital particles flow from the cursor, and small, stylized code snippets are visible on a nearby tablet, hinting at the software's nature. The overall mood is creative and accessible, emphasizing the ease of building diagrams with text. The style should be a 3D isometric illustration with a friendly, modern aesthetic."
