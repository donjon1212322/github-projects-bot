Meet SSHM, Your New Terminal Superpower\npublished: True\ntags: ssh, terminal, cli, tui\n---\n\n## Quick Summary: 📝\nSSHM is a command-line SSH manager written in Go that provides a TUI for managing and connecting to SSH hosts. It simplifies SSH connection management with features like port forwarding, tag support, smart search, and real-time status updates, aiming to make the process more efficient and user-friendly.\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ SSHM provides an interactive TUI to manage SSH configurations, eliminating the need for manual text file editing.\n\n* ✅ It works directly with your existing `~/.ssh/config` file, ensuring security and zero migration effort.\n\n* ✅ Features like tagging, smart search, and real-time connectivity status drastically improve organization and speed.\n\n* ✅ Advanced configurations, including ProxyJump and complex Port Forwarding (Local, Remote, and SOCKS), are made easy through intuitive forms.\n\n* ✅ Built with Go, SSHM is lightweight, cross-platform, and distributed as a single, dependency-free binary.\n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 827\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 45\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 12\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ Go\n\n\nWe all know the pain of managing a sprawling `~/.ssh/config` file. As the number of servers, clients, and environments grows, that essential file turns into a dense, confusing mess of aliases, ports, and options. If you manage dozens of hosts, finding the right entry, ensuring syntax correctness, or setting up complex tunnels often becomes a tedious task that significantly slows down your daily workflow. SSHM is designed to eliminate this friction entirely, transforming tedious configuration management into a slick, interactive experience right in your terminal.\r\n\r\nSSHM is an interactive SSH Manager built with Go, offering a beautiful Terminal User Interface (TUI). Think of it as a powerful, graphical dashboard for your SSH configurations, running entirely within your command line without requiring any external dependencies. Crucially, it doesn't try to replace your existing SSH setup; instead, it securely reads and writes directly to your standard `~/.ssh/config` file. This approach ensures zero migration headache, instant compatibility with all your existing hosts, and full support for complex features like `Include` directives and `ProxyJump` tunneling.\r\n\r\nThe real magic of SSHM lies in its usability enhancements. Forget manually editing text files just to change a user or update a port number. SSHM provides intuitive forms for adding, editing, and moving configurations seamlessly. Need to categorize your infrastructure? Utilize the built-in tagging system and smart search filters to find your dev, staging, or production hosts instantly. It also provides real-time, color-coded status indicators based on asynchronous ping checks, allowing you to instantly see if a host is reachable before you even attempt a connection.\r\n\r\nFor developers dealing with complex network architectures, SSHM is a game-changer for advanced tasks. Setting up port forwarding—whether Local, Remote, or Dynamic (SOCKS) forwarding—is incredibly simple through the TUI, and the tool even persists your history for quick reuse. Furthermore, SSHM allows for lightning-fast connections, either by navigating the interactive TUI or directly via the command line using `sshm <host>`. This tool is cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows) and distributed as a single, lightweight binary, making installation and adoption remarkably fast. SSHM isn't just about managing connections; it’s about eliminating configuration friction and boosting your productivity immediately.\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/Gu1llaum-3/sshm)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
