It visualizes code changes with realistic typing animations, syntax highlighting, and file tree transitions, making code evolution a visual experience.\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ Transforms Git commit history into cinematic, animated terminal replays with realistic typing effects.\n\n* ✅ Features Tree-sitter syntax highlighting and a dynamic file tree visualization for enhanced clarity.\n\n* ✅ Excellent for educational demos, technical presentations, and creating engaging development content.\n\n* ✅ Includes a unique 'Screensaver Mode' that loops random commits for an ambient coding display.\n\n* ✅ Built with Rust, ensuring fast, lightweight performance and extensive customization options for themes and typing speed.\n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 3907\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 86\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 8\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ Rust\n\n\nGitlogue is a fascinating utility that takes your standard Git commit history and elevates it into a fully cinematic, animated spectacle directly within your terminal. Its primary function is to transform static code changes into a dynamic, living story, allowing you to literally watch your code base evolve commit by commit. This goes far beyond a simple `git diff`; it simulates the actual coding process.\n\nThe way it achieves this is by meticulously analyzing the delta between commits and then replaying those changes using realistic typing animations, deletions, and cursor movements. When you execute `gitlogue`, you see a split view: on one side, a dynamic project file tree that updates to reflect the changes, and on the other, a high-fidelity code editor. This editor benefits from Tree-sitter powered syntax highlighting, supporting dozens of languages, ensuring the visual playback is both accurate and beautiful. You can configure the speed of the typing, even setting custom rules so that Java files type faster than XML configuration files, for instance, adding a layer of authenticity to the simulation.\n\nFor developers, the utility of gitlogue is immense, extending into education, presentations, and workflow enhancement. Imagine needing to onboard a new team member; instead of walking them through abstract commit messages, you can use gitlogue to visually demonstrate the development lifecycle of a major feature. For content creators or presenters, replaying a clean, animated commit history is dramatically more engaging than scrolling through a GitHub history page. Furthermore, the tool includes a \"Screensaver Mode\" which continuously loops random commits, providing a captivating ambient display for your workspace—a fun way to appreciate the team's ongoing work. Since it's built using Rust, performance is snappy and resource usage is minimal, making it a powerful yet lightweight addition to any terminal setup. It’s a unique way to visualize the history of your project, turning the mundane task of reviewing history into an enjoyable experience.\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/unhappychoice/gitlogue)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
