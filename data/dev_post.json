Analyze Compose Stability in Real-Time Right Inside Your IDE\npublished: True\ntags: jetpack, android, performance, ide\n---\n\n## Quick Summary: 📝\nCompose Stability Analyzer is an IntelliJ plugin that provides real-time, visual analysis of Jetpack Compose composable function stability directly within Android Studio. It helps developers identify and fix performance issues by offering insights into why composables are stable or unstable, tracing recomposition reasons, and generating compatibility reports.\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ Provides real-time, visual stability analysis directly within Android Studio/IntelliJ.\n\n* ✅ Uses gutter icons and hover tooltips to instantly identify unstable composables and their root causes.\n\n* ✅ Supports detailed recomposition tracing using the `TraceRecomposition` annotation for deep debugging.\n\n* ✅ Allows exporting stability compatibility reports via Gradle tasks for team performance tracking.\n\n* ✅ Highly customizable, supporting features like Strong Skipping mode and analysis in test source sets.\n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 1133\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 19\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 6\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ Kotlin\n\n\nThe Compose Stability Analyzer is an essential IntelliJ plugin designed to tackle the biggest performance headache in Compose development: unstable composables. Its core purpose is simple yet powerful: it provides real-time, visual feedback right inside Android Studio, eliminating the need to wait for build-time reports or complex runtime tracing to diagnose stability issues. It acts like a powerful X-ray machine for your UI code, instantly showing you exactly which functions are fully stable and which ones might be causing performance bottlenecks, ensuring your UI remains buttery smooth.\n\nThis analyzer integrates seamlessly into your coding environment using intuitive visual cues. You'll see colored gutter icons next to your composable functions—these are instant indicators of their stability status. If you hover over these icons or the function itself, detailed tooltips pop up, explaining the precise reason why the function or its parameters are considered stable or unstable. This immediate feedback loop is crucial. For instance, if you pass an unstable class instance as a parameter, the analyzer will tell you exactly which property within that class is causing the instability, allowing for surgical fixes rather than broad refactoring or guesswork.\n\nBeyond simple stability checks, the project offers deeper debugging tools essential for complex applications. If you suspect a composable is recomposing too often, even when its stability status looks okay, you can leverage the `TraceRecomposition` annotation. This feature logs exactly when and why the function was triggered, offering clear, actionable insights into the execution flow that standard debuggers often miss. Furthermore, for teams focused on maintaining strict performance standards, the analyzer includes Gradle tasks that export comprehensive stability compatibility reports. This is invaluable for reviewing code changes, especially when introducing new dependencies or refactoring large UI modules, ensuring that stability regressions are caught before they are merged.\n\nThe tool is highly customizable to fit any developer's workflow and preference. You can easily adjust the indicator colors to match your favorite IDE theme, enabling a dedicated \"Strong Skipping mode\" for stricter analysis, and even configure it to run analysis on your test source sets to ensure comprehensive coverage. By bringing stability analysis directly into the IDE, the Compose Stability Analyzer shifts performance optimization left. This means developers can fix potential performance issues instantly while writing the code, leading to cleaner, faster, and more maintainable Compose applications right from the start. This proactive approach saves countless hours otherwise spent debugging slow UIs later in the development cycle, letting you focus on feature development instead of chasing elusive recomposition bugs.\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/skydoves/compose-stability-analyzer)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
