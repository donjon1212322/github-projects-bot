But it's not just a static image; Bongo Cat reacts in real-time to your keyboard input! Every keystroke triggers a delightful animation of Bongo Cat pounding those bongos, making coding sessions feel a little less monotonous and a lot more entertaining.\n\nWhat makes this project truly special is its seamless integration with Wayland, a modern display server.  This means it's lightweight, efficient, and designed to work perfectly with many modern Linux distributions.  Forget about clunky overlays that hog your system resources; Bongo Cat is incredibly lean, using only about 2MB of RAM. It's optimized for performance, meaning you won't see any lag or slowdowns, even during intense coding sessions.\n\nBut the fun doesn't stop there! The project boasts a hot-reload configuration feature, allowing you to tweak settings like cat size, position, animation speed, and opacity without restarting the application. This is a game changer for those who like to experiment and fine-tune their setup.  You can even configure multiple keyboard devices simultaneously, making it perfect for those who use external keyboards or have multiple inputs.\n\nThe installation is surprisingly straightforward. Arch Linux users have it particularly easy, with packages readily available through AUR helpers like yay or paru.  Other distributions can compile from source, and the README provides clear, step-by-step instructions for various systems, including Ubuntu/Debian, Fedora, and even NixOS. This cross-platform compatibility is a big plus, ensuring a wider range of developers can enjoy the Bongo Cat experience.\n\nSo, why should you care?
