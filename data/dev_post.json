It leverages Apple's Virtualization.Framework for near-native performance and offers features like pre-built image support, configuration modification, and a local API server.  The tool supports both macOS and Linux VMs and can be installed via Homebrew.\n\n## Key Takeaways: üí°\n\n* ‚úÖ Effortlessly create, run, and manage macOS and Linux VMs.\n\n* ‚úÖ Achieve near-native performance on Apple Silicon using Apple's Virtualization.Framework.\n\n* ‚úÖ Simplified workflow with intuitive CLI commands and Python API (pylume).\n\n* ‚úÖ Comprehensive features including VM creation, management, cloning, and image pulling.\n\n* ‚úÖ Save time and boost productivity by streamlining VM management tasks\n\n\n## Project Statistics: üìä\n* ‚≠ê **Stars:** 1991\n* üç¥ **Forks:** 24\n* ‚ùó **Open Issues:** 14\n\n\n## Tech Stack: üíª\n- ‚úÖ Swift\n\n\nLume: Effortless macOS and Linux Virtual Machine Management\n\nTired of the hassle of setting up and managing virtual machines?  Meet Lume, the lightweight command-line interface (CLI) and local API server that simplifies the process dramatically. Lume allows you to create, run, and manage macOS and Linux VMs with incredible ease, achieving near-native performance on Apple Silicon hardware.  This is a game-changer for developers who need to test software across different operating systems or work with specific environments.\n\nOne of the most appealing aspects of Lume is its simplicity. Forget wrestling with complex virtualization software; Lume streamlines the entire workflow.  Want to run a pre-built macOS image?  One command is all it takes.  Need to create a new VM?  Lume's intuitive commands guide you through the process, letting you specify details like CPU cores, memory, and disk size with ease.  You can even share directories between your host machine and the VM for seamless file access.\n\nBut Lume isn't just about ease of use; it's also about performance.  Leveraging Apple's Virtualization.Framework, Lume delivers near-native performance on Apple Silicon chips, making your virtual machines feel incredibly responsive. This is crucial for developers who need a fast and efficient development environment.  No more sluggish VMs slowing down your workflow!\n\nLume also offers a comprehensive set of commands.  Beyond creating and running VMs, you can list all your VMs, get detailed information about them, modify their configurations, stop and delete them, and even clone existing VMs to quickly create duplicates.  Need to pull a macOS image from a container registry?  Lume handles that too.  It provides a simple, consistent interface for all your VM management needs.\n\nFor developers who prefer a more programmatic approach, Lume also offers a Python interface, pylume.  This allows you to integrate VM management into your existing Python workflows, automating tasks and enhancing your development pipeline.  This level of integration is a huge advantage for developers working on larger projects or those who need to automate repetitive tasks.\n\nLume is not just a tool; it's a time-saver.  By simplifying the process of managing virtual machines, Lume allows developers to focus on what matters most: building software.  The ability to quickly spin up and tear down VMs, along with its intuitive interface and excellent performance, makes Lume a must-have tool for any developer's arsenal. Its versatility, supported by both CLI and Python API, makes it suitable for diverse development needs, from individual projects to large-scale automation.\n\nWhether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, Lume's ease of use, performance, and comprehensive feature set make it an invaluable tool for any developer working with macOS or Linux virtual machines.  Try it out and experience the difference!\n\n## Learn More: üîó\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/trycua/lume)\n\n---\nüåü **Enjoyed this project?** Get a daily dose of awesome open-source discoveries by following [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source) on Telegram! ‚ú®",
