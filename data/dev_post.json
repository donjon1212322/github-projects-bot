It allows users to organize information into notebooks, generate notes, perform web searches, and even create interactive applications (Surflets) powered by user-selected AI models, all while prioritizing local data storage and open formats.\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ Unifies research, note-taking, and AI analysis across diverse media types (PDFs, videos, web pages) in one application.\n\n* ✅ Smart Notes feature enables context-aware referencing via `@-mentions` and generates automatic, deep-linked citations to sources.\n\n* ✅ Leverages a local-first, open-format architecture (SFFS) built using Rust, Svelte, and TypeScript, ensuring data privacy and high performance.\n\n* ✅ Includes 'Surflets' for AI-powered generation of interactive code applets directly within your notes for visualization and rapid prototyping.\n\n* ✅ Eliminates workflow friction by integrating web search, split-view multitasking, and synthesis tools into a single environment.\n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 3190\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 225\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 18\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ TypeScript\n\n\nWe all know the pain of deep research: juggling a dozen browser tabs, opening external PDFs, keeping a separate note-taking app open, and constantly copying and pasting snippets while desperately trying to maintain context. Deta Surf aims to eliminate this workflow chaos by merging research, documentation, and powerful AI analysis into one seamless, integrated environment. It’s not just another note-taker; it’s designed specifically for synthesis and deep thinking across diverse media.\n\nAt its core, Surf functions as a robust multi-media library. It doesn't just handle plain text; it intelligently indexes almost any resource you throw at it—local files, PDFs, full websites, and even YouTube videos. Crucially, all this data is stored locally on your machine using the Surf Flat File System (SFFS). This commitment to local-first data storage and open formats (it’s built with high-performance Rust, TypeScript, and Svelte) means your research remains private, transparent, and often accessible even when you're offline.\n\nThe real magic unfolds within the Smart Notes feature. Imagine you are writing a complex analysis. Instead of manually searching for that key quote, you can simply use an `@-mention` to reference a specific section of a saved PDF or a crucial timestamp in a video you viewed earlier. The integrated AI can then leverage these referenced sources to synthesize new information directly into your note, automatically generating integrated citations that deep-link back to the exact location in the original source material. This capability completely eliminates the manual grunt work of hunting, copying, and pasting.\n\nFor developers, the built-in 'Surflets' feature is a game-changer. If you need a quick utility, data visualization, or interactive helper application to explore a concept—perhaps a temporary code snippet parser or a simple chart—you don't have to leave your notes or fire up a separate IDE. You can ask the AI to generate an interactive applet right inside your document. This transforms your notes from static text into dynamic, executable environments, perfect for rapid prototyping and idea exploration.\n\nSurf’s architecture, utilizing modern technologies like Rust for performance and Svelte for a snappy UI, ensures a fast, cross-platform experience on MacOS, Windows, and Linux. The project’s focus on being open source and user-centric, combined with powerful features like split-view browsing and integrated web search, makes Deta Surf a compelling tool for anyone serious about elevating their research and documentation workflow. It is truly an open, powerful accelerator designed to boost productivity and intellectual clarity.\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/deta/surf)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
