It supports both a text-based user interface (TUI) and a command-line interface (CLI), offering flexibility for different workflows. Pop can integrate with email services like Resend or traditional SMTP, and can be combined with other CLI tools for advanced email automation.\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ Pop enables sending emails directly from the terminal using both an interactive TUI and a powerful CLI.\n\n* ✅ It supports flexible delivery via traditional SMTP configuration or modern email APIs like Resend.\n\n* ✅ The CLI allows for powerful automation and scripting by piping content from other tools and attaching files easily.\n\n* ✅ Pop integrates seamlessly with the Charm ecosystem and other CLI utilities (like mods and gum) to create advanced email workflows, such as AI-drafting or interactive recipient selection.\n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 2733\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 67\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 21\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ Go\n\n\nWe often live and breathe in the terminal, executing commands, writing code, and managing services. So why should sending an email require context switching to a heavy GUI application or navigating a slow web browser? This constant friction interrupts focus and slows down automated workflows. Pop solves this fundamental problem by bringing full email capability right into your command line environment. It's designed for developers who value speed, efficiency, and automation, allowing you to handle crucial communication without ever leaving the flow state of your terminal session. This isn't just a basic mailer; it's a powerful, composable tool built specifically for the modern, terminal-centric developer.\n\nPop offers two fantastic ways to send mail, catering to different needs. If you prefer an interactive experience for composing a one-off message, just typing `pop` launches a beautiful Text-based User Interface (TUI). This interface lets you easily compose the body, add recipients, and set subjects using familiar keyboard shortcuts, all styled with Charm's signature, aesthetically pleasing design. For power users and automation fanatics, the true magic lies in the Command Line Interface (CLI). The CLI allows you to pipe content directly into Pop, setting the `from`, `to`, `subject`, and even attaching files using simple, intuitive flags. Imagine generating a dynamic build report or a database backup and emailing it to your team in a single, chained command, all executed instantly upon completion.\n\nOne of Pop's most appealing features is its flexibility in delivery configuration. It doesn't force you into a proprietary ecosystem. You can easily configure it using traditional SMTP settings (perfect for connecting to services like Gmail or your corporate server) simply by setting a few standard environment variables like host, port, username, and password. Even better, it offers seamless integration with modern email delivery APIs like Resend. If you have a `RESEND_API_KEY`, setting up Pop is virtually instantaneous, offering reliable, high-volume email delivery capabilities right from your shell scripts. This dual support makes Pop incredibly versatile, whether you are using it for local development testing or integrating it into production deployment pipelines for automated notifications.\n\nWhere Pop truly elevates the terminal experience is its ability to integrate flawlessly with the wider ecosystem of CLI tools. Because it handles input via standard piping, it becomes an essential building block in complex, automated workflows. For example, you can combine it with `charmbracelet/mods` to draft an entire email body using AI and pipe that text directly into Pop, adding a subject line and recipient, all in one elegant command line instruction. Need to send a time-sensitive invoice? Combine Pop with a tool like `invoice` to generate a PDF and use Pop's `--attach` flag to instantly send it off to your client. You can even use `gum` for interactive selection, allowing you to choose recipients from a dynamically filtered list before sending the final message. Pop transforms email communication from a tedious, context-switching task into an elegant, repeatable, and scriptable action, drastically improving developer efficiency and embracing the true power of the command line philosophy.\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/charmbracelet/pop)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
