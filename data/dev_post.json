Are you tired of unreliable internet slowing down your workflow?  Do you ever wonder if your ISP is delivering the speeds they promised?  Then get ready to meet Speedtest Tracker, a game-changing self-hosted application that's about to become your new best friend.  This isn't your average speed test; it's a comprehensive monitoring system that keeps a constant eye on your connection, providing detailed insights and alerts.  Think of it as a personal internet performance detective, always on the case.  Speedtest Tracker automates the process of testing your internet speed at regular intervals. It goes beyond just showing you the current speed; it captures a wealth of data, including download and upload speeds, ping, and packet loss.  This information is then neatly presented in an easy-to-understand dashboard, allowing you to visualize your connection's performance over time.  The real magic, however, lies in its ability to track this data over time.  You can see historical trends, identify recurring issues, and even get notifications if your connection dips below a certain threshold.  This proactive approach allows you to address problems before they significantly impact your productivity.  The beauty of Speedtest Tracker is its simplicity. It's containerized, meaning you can run it practically anywhere—from your home server to cloud platforms like Docker.  The setup process is straightforward, with clear documentation guiding you through the steps.  Plus, there are pre-built images available for popular NAS systems like Synology and Unraid, making deployment a breeze.  The application is highly configurable, allowing you to tailor the testing frequency and notification settings to your specific needs.  You can choose how often you want speed tests to run and what conditions trigger alerts—whether it's a drop in download speed, high latency, or significant packet loss.  Speedtest Tracker is more than just a tool; it's a time-saver. Imagine the hours you'll save by proactively identifying and resolving internet issues before they disrupt your workflow.  It offers peace of mind, knowing that your connection is constantly being monitored and that you'll be alerted immediately if anything goes wrong.  No more guesswork or frustrating troubleshooting sessions—just clear, actionable data at your fingertips.  If you're a developer who values efficiency, reliability, and a proactive approach to problem-solving, then Speedtest Tracker is a must-have. It's the ultimate tool for ensuring your internet connection remains a consistent and reliable asset, not a source of frustration.  Give it a try; you won't regret it!\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/alexjustesen/speedtest-tracker)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
