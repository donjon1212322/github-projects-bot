It allows users to send messages, files, and audio calls over various interfaces, including local networks, the internet, and LoRa radio, with a focus on secure communication and compatibility with other LXMF clients like Sideband and Nomadnet.\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ Enables secure, off-grid communication using mesh networking over interfaces like LoRa radio, Wi-Fi, and Ethernet.\n\n* ✅ Built on the Reticulum Network Stack (RNS) and LXMF, providing automatic, decentralized routing and robust encryption.\n\n* ✅ Supports file transfers and low-bandwidth audio calls optimized for long-distance, low-power links.\n\n* ✅ Interoperable with other LXMF clients (Sideband, Nomadnet), expanding the decentralized communication ecosystem.\n\n* ✅ Developers can contribute to network resilience by running LXMF Propagation Nodes and exploring decentralized content (micron pages).\n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 665\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 56\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 51\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ JavaScript\n\n\nImagine a communication app that works even if the internet goes down, or if you're miles away from the nearest cell tower. That's the revolutionary promise of Reticulum MeshChat. This project is a versatile, secure messaging application built on top of the powerful Reticulum Network Stack, or RNS. RNS acts as an intelligent framework, treating all connection types\r\n—from standard Ethernet and Wi-Fi to low-power radio—as equal interfaces for routing data. Essentially, it automatically forms a self-healing, decentralized mesh network wherever compatible devices are present.\r\nThe core magic lies in its support for low-power, license-free LoRa radio, especially when paired with hardware like an RNode. LoRa is designed for long-distance, low-bandwidth communication, making it the perfect backbone for off-grid messaging. MeshChat leverages this capability to send encrypted messages, files, and even highly compressed audio calls (thanks to codec2 optimization) across potentially vast distances. The system ensures messages hop securely between nodes until they reach their intended recipient, bypassing traditional cellular or internet infrastructure entirely. This feature is crucial for emergency communication, remote exploration, or simply maintaining privacy and independence from central service providers.\r\nSecurity is paramount in Reticulum MeshChat. All communication is inherently secure and private, utilizing the LXMF protocol. Messages can only be decrypted by the intended destination, offering robust privacy guarantees. Furthermore, this application is not a closed system. It is fully interoperable with other LXMF clients, such as Sideband and Nomadnet, meaning you are instantly joining a wider ecosystem of decentralized communication tools and networks.\r\nFor developers, Reticulum MeshChat offers a compelling sandbox for exploring true peer-to-peer networking and resilient system design. You have the power to easily set up your device as an LXMF Propagation Node, effectively turning it into a relay point for message storage and retrieval for others in the network. This allows you to contribute directly to the network's resilience. Beyond messaging, you can dive into decentralized content by browsing \"micron pages,\" which are decentralized websites hosted on Nomad Network nodes. This project is an open-source opportunity to understand and build applications that function independent of large, centralized cloud providers, pushing the boundaries of resilient communication technology.\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/liamcottle/reticulum-meshchat)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
