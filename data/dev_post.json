It allows users to interact with databases using plain English and can return both the generated SQL and the query results.\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ QueryWeaver converts plain English questions into accurate SQL queries (Text2SQL).\n\n* ✅ It uses graph-powered schema understanding to ensure superior query accuracy and context awareness across complex databases.\n\n* ✅ The project is easily deployable via Docker and accessible through a robust REST API for seamless application integration.\n\n* ✅ It supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling standardized interaction within larger AI/ML workflows.\n\n* ✅ Developers can dramatically speed up ad-hoc data querying and reporting tasks, simplifying data access for non-SQL experts.\n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 267\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 27\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 31\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ Python\n\n\nHow many times have you stared at a complex database schema, dreading the hour you’re about to spend crafting that perfect, multi-join SQL query? We all love data, but wrestling with syntax and obscure table names can be a massive productivity killer. This is exactly the headache that QueryWeaver is designed to eliminate. It’s an open-source tool that acts as your universal translator, converting your everyday English questions directly into precise SQL queries and, even better, giving you the results instantly.\n\nQueryWeaver isn't just another language model slapped onto a database connector; its core innovation lies in its \"graph-powered schema understanding.\" Think of your database schema not as a flat list of tables, but as a complex network of relationships. QueryWeaver leverages graph technology to deeply understand how your tables connect, which columns are relevant, and the context of the data. When you ask, \"Show me all customers who bought products made in 2023,\" it doesn't just look for keywords; it maps the path from 'customers' to 'products' through intermediate tables, ensuring the generated SQL is accurate and efficient. This graph-based approach significantly reduces the common hallucination errors often seen in simpler Text2SQL tools.\n\nFor developers, the integration couldn't be simpler. QueryWeaver is packaged as a lightweight REST API service, meaning you can plug it into virtually any application—whether it's a dashboard, a chatbot, or a data analysis pipeline. Deployment is incredibly smooth thanks to its official Docker image. You can have the entire service running locally with a single `docker run` command, making evaluation and production setup painless. Furthermore, it supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP), offering standardized endpoints for database operations like listing schemas and querying data. This means QueryWeaver can easily integrate into larger, modular AI ecosystems.\n\nThe practical benefits are immediate. Imagine reducing the time spent on ad-hoc reporting from hours to seconds. Data analysts can bypass the need for deep SQL knowledge, accessing insights simply by asking questions. As a developer, you gain a powerful layer between your application and the database, allowing you to focus on feature development rather than query optimization. QueryWeaver democratizes data access, making complex information available to everyone on the team through natural language. If you work with databases and want to drastically simplify how you interact with them, QueryWeaver is a must-check-out project.\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/FalkorDB/QueryWeaver)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
