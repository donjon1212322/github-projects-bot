It aims to provide a fast, intuitive, and efficient way to connect, query, and inspect database data without the need for heavy graphical applications.\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ sqlit is an ultra-fast Terminal UI (TUI) that replaces heavy GUI database clients and slow IDE extensions.\n\n* ✅ It offers massive compatibility, supporting over 20 database providers, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, Snowflake, and DuckDB.\n\n* ✅ The tool features intelligent Docker container auto-discovery, allowing one-click connections to local development databases.\n\n* ✅ Credentials are stored securely using your OS keyring, ensuring safe and easy management of multiple connections.\n\n* ✅ Advanced TUI features include Vim keybindings, robust SQL autocompletion, and efficient fuzzy filtering of millions of result rows.\n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 3302\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 87\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 14\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ Python\n\n\nWe all know the pain of needing to run a quick SQL query, only to wait for a massive GUI application like SSMS or a heavy IDE extension to load. This constant context switching and resource drain is exactly the problem `sqlit` solves. It’s designed specifically for developers who value speed and efficiency, offering a full-featured, yet incredibly lightweight, database client right in your terminal. Think of it as the `lazygit` for your data—instantaneous access without sacrificing any necessary power.\n\nAt its core, `sqlit` is a powerful Terminal User Interface (TUI) built on Python, making it fast and easy to install via `pipx`. Once launched, you don't need complicated CLI arguments. The tool provides a visual, yet text-based, interface for everything from connection management and schema browsing to query execution. The compatibility is massive; it supports over 20 major database providers, ranging from traditional PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server, to modern cloud data warehouses like Snowflake, DuckDB, and even specialized services like CloudFlare D1 and Turso. This breadth of support means you can standardize on one tool for nearly all your data sources.\n\nOne of the most impressive productivity boosters is its intelligent Docker integration. If you have database containers running locally for development, `sqlit` automatically detects them and allows you to connect instantly with a single keystroke. It handles figuring out the necessary connection details for you, eliminating manual port mapping and configuration headaches. Furthermore, security is paramount: connection passwords are saved securely in your operating system's native keyring, ensuring your credentials are safe while still allowing seamless switching between saved connections.\n\nFor developers obsessed with keyboard shortcuts and efficiency, `sqlit` shines. It offers optional Vim-style keybindings for querying, history navigation, and result inspection, catering to terminal purists. When you execute a query, the results pane is highly optimized, capable of handling and fuzzy searching through millions of rows without slowing down your machine. You get robust syntax highlighting, context-aware SQL autocompletion based on your current schema, and a searchable history for all your past queries, organized per connection. Whether you are connecting to local databases, securing connections via SSH tunnels, or integrating with cloud CLIs like AWS, GCP, or Azure, `sqlit` streamlines the entire workflow, making database interaction enjoyable again and keeping you firmly in your terminal environment.\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/Maxteabag/sqlit)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
