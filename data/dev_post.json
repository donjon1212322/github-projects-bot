It outputs drawings in SVG format and supports collaborative editing.\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ Offers an effectively infinite canvas thanks to an extremely large zoom range (10⁻¹⁰x to 10¹⁰x) for high-precision drawing.\n\n* ✅ Features robust, high-quality support for touchscreens and styluses, including rotation snapping and the ability to disable touch drawing.\n\n* ✅ Provides user-configurable drawing tools and supports adding custom pen types, ensuring high flexibility for niche applications.\n\n* ✅ Includes built-in support for collaborative editing, significantly simplifying the creation of real-time multi-user applications.\n\n* ✅ Uses SVG for saving and loading content, guaranteeing interoperability and scalability of drawn assets.\n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 244\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 24\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 17\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ TypeScript\n\n\nIf you've ever tried to build a serious drawing or annotation feature for a web application, you know the headaches involved. Handling varied inputs, managing performance at scale, and implementing features like seamless zooming can quickly turn into an engineering nightmare. This is exactly where `js-draw` steps in, offering a complete, high-performance solution right out of the box, allowing developers to focus on their application logic instead of low-level canvas manipulation.\n\nOne of the most mind-blowing features of `js-draw` is its truly massive zoom range. We're talking about zooming capabilities spanning from roughly 10⁻¹⁰x all the way up to 10¹⁰x. Think of it as an effectively infinite canvas. This isn't just a parlor trick; it’s essential for applications that require extreme precision, like technical diagrams, detailed educational annotations, or complex digital whiteboards. Whether your user needs to see the big picture or zoom in to refine a single pixel-sized detail, the experience remains smooth and responsive.\n\nInput handling is another area where this library shines, particularly for users on modern devices. `js-draw` provides first-class support for touchscreens and styluses. It handles gestures like pinch-to-zoom and rotation natively. Crucially, it includes thoughtful UX features like rotation snapping, which locks the canvas rotation to clean 90-degree multiples, making editing much simpler. For developers targeting professional users, the ability to easily disable touch drawing—allowing stylus users to rest their hand on the screen without accidental marks—is a massive quality-of-life improvement that boosts productivity.\n\nThe project is also designed for maximum flexibility and user control. Users aren't stuck with predefined tools; they can fully configure pen styles, colors, size, and even advanced settings like stroke stabilization and autocorrect, all through a clean, built-in interface. For developers, this extensibility means you can easily inject custom pen types into the toolbar, tailoring the drawing experience to your specific niche application. Furthermore, the library supports saving and restoring the entire toolbar state, ensuring a consistent experience across sessions.\n\nBeyond the core drawing mechanics, `js-draw` tackles the challenges of modern application requirements. It offers robust support for collaborative editing, meaning you can integrate real-time multi-user functionality into your whiteboard application with significantly less effort than building the synchronization layer yourself. Finally, all the work created within the editor can be saved to and loaded from a subset of SVG, ensuring that the output is standardized, scalable, and easily interoperable with other graphics tools. This combination of extreme scalability, robust input handling, and modern feature support makes `js-draw` an indispensable tool for anyone building interactive drawing experiences on the web.\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/personalizedrefrigerator/js-draw)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
