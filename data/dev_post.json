It allows users to track their subscriptions, visualize spending habits, receive renewal reminders, and manage their finances effectively.\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ SubTrackr is a self-hosted subscription manager built with Go and HTMX, prioritizing data privacy and high performance.\n\n* ✅ The minimal tech stack (Go, SQLite, HTMX) allows for extremely easy, dependency-free deployment using Docker.\n\n* ✅ Features robust analytics, including real-time spending tracking, multi-currency support, and optional user authentication.\n\n* ✅ Provides critical renewal reminders via email and Pushover notifications, coupled with a visual calendar view to prevent surprise charges.\n\n* ✅ The project is highly customizable, offering five distinct themes and full data export capabilities (CSV, JSON, iCal).\n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 374\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 15\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 13\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ Go\n\n\nIt's easy to lose track of all those monthly and annual subscriptions we accumulate. From streaming services to SaaS tools, the recurring costs can quietly chip away at your budget, often leading to unpleasant surprises when a renewal hits unexpectedly. This is exactly the headache that SubTrackr is designed to eliminate, giving you back control over your digital finances in a beautifully simple, self-hosted package.\n\nSubTrackr operates as your personal financial watchdog, dedicated solely to monitoring your recurring expenses. Unlike relying on spreadsheets or third-party cloud services, this application runs entirely on your infrastructure, ensuring maximum privacy since your sensitive spending data never leaves your server. The core functionality centers around a sleek dashboard that provides instant visibility into your total monthly and annual spending, broken down by category. It’s like having a dedicated accountant for your subscriptions, without the fees.\n\nThe architecture is fascinating for developers looking at modern, efficient stacks. SubTrackr is built on Go (Golang) for the backend, leveraging the speed and reliability that Go offers. Crucially, the frontend embraces the increasingly popular philosophy of \"HTML Over The Wire\" using HTMX and Tailwind CSS. This combination means the application is incredibly snappy and lightweight. You get a rich, dynamic user experience without needing a heavy JavaScript framework, simplifying development and deployment significantly. Plus, the built-in SQLite database means there are zero external database dependencies, making installation via Docker incredibly straightforward—you can be up and running in minutes.\n\nFor practical day-to-day use, SubTrackr excels in visualization and notification. The Calendar View is a standout feature, allowing you to see all upcoming renewal dates laid out clearly, preventing those dreaded surprise charges. Need to move your data or integrate with other tools? SubTrackr supports comprehensive data exports in formats like CSV, JSON, and even iCal for calendar integration. Furthermore, the notification system is robust, offering reminders via email or even mobile push notifications through Pushover, ensuring you have ample warning before a billing cycle closes.\n\nDevelopers will also appreciate the attention to detail in customization. SubTrackr supports multiple currencies, including optional real-time conversion features, making it globally relevant. And for those who love personalizing their tools, there are five gorgeous themes available, including a fun, animated Christmas theme. This project is a fantastic example of how powerful and feature-rich a modern, self-hosted application can be when built with efficiency and user experience in mind. It solves a real-world financial problem using an elegant, high-performance tech stack. It's definitely a must-try for anyone interested in Go, HTMX, or simply better financial organization.\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/bscott/subtrackr)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
