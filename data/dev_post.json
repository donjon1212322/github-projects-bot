It also supports a range of operating systems, including Linux and macOS, making the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. experience more accessible than ever before.  The new OpenGL renderer brings stunning visual improvements, while performance enhancements deliver smoother gameplay and better frame rates.\n\nFor modders, OpenXRay is a game-changer.  The project introduces a modern, modular architecture that simplifies the process of adding new graphics features, improving performance through multi-threading, and enhancing the overall modding experience.  A new game SDK is also under development, providing modders with even more tools and capabilities to create truly amazing modifications.\n\nThe project is actively developed and maintained by a passionate community.  This ensures that the engine is constantly improving, with new features and bug fixes added regularly.  The community is also incredibly welcoming and supportive, offering help to newcomers and providing a collaborative environment for modders of all skill levels.  So, whether you're a seasoned modder or a casual player, OpenXRay has something to offer.\n\nBeyond the technical improvements, OpenXRay represents a commitment to preserving and enhancing a beloved game series.
