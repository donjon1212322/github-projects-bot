It organizes financial data, detects subscriptions, and provides insights without sending any data to the cloud.\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ Achieves automatic expense tracking solely by parsing bank SMS notifications on Android devices.\n\n* ✅ Guarantees 100% data privacy by executing all AI processing and categorization directly on the device, eliminating cloud reliance.\n\n* ✅ Supports multi-currency tracking and parsing for 40+ banks across multiple international regions.\n\n* ✅ Offers an on-device AI assistant for natural language querying of spending habits without sending data externally.\n\n* ✅ The open-source Kotlin codebase serves as an excellent reference for developers building privacy-focused applications utilizing edge machine learning.\n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 354\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 56\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 22\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ Kotlin\n\n\nWe all know the hassle of manually tracking expenses. Dealing with spreadsheets or trusting sensitive financial data to third-party cloud services can feel risky and time-consuming. This is precisely the problem PennyWise AI solves, offering a revolutionary, privacy-first expense tracking solution built right into your Android phone. It transforms those scattered bank SMS alerts into a clean, searchable financial timeline, completely automatically.\n\nThe core genius of PennyWise AI lies in its simplicity and commitment to user privacy. When your bank sends an SMS notification about a transaction, the app intercepts and reads only that specific message—it never sends messages or modifies your inbox. It then employs sophisticated, yet entirely local, AI models to parse the messy, often inconsistent text from different banks. It automatically extracts the key data points: the transaction amount, the merchant name, the spending category (like \"Groceries\" or \"Fuel\"), and the date.\n\nThe most crucial aspect for privacy-conscious developers is that PennyWise AI performs 100% of its smart processing on the device itself. There are absolutely no servers involved in handling your financial details. This isn't just a marketing claim; it's fundamental to its architecture, utilizing cutting-edge on-device machine learning capabilities, making it a massive differentiator in the financial tracking space where data security is paramount.\n\nFor developers, this open-source project written in Kotlin is a goldmine. You can dive deep into the codebase and see exactly how the team tackled complex challenges like multi-bank SMS parsing and multi-currency localization, supporting 40+ banks across five countries. If you need to extend support for a new regional bank or currency, the framework is transparent and ready for contribution. This is a fantastic educational resource for anyone interested in practical application of edge ML.\n\nBeyond basic tracking, PennyWise AI provides clear insights, automatically detects recurring subscriptions, and includes an on-device AI assistant. This assistant allows users to ask natural language questions, such as \"What did I spend on dining out last month?\" or \"Show me all transactions at this specific merchant.\" This powerful feature, executed locally, dramatically reduces the friction associated with personal finance management, turning a tedious chore into an automated, insightful process, all while keeping the user firmly in control of their data.\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/sarim2000/pennywiseai-tracker)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
