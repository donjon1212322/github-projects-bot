It emphasizes privacy and security through end-to-end encryption and peer-to-peer direct transfers, offering a WeTransfer alternative without accounts or personal information.\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ Achieve blazing-fast file transfers using direct Peer-to-Peer (P2P) connections, bypassing traditional cloud servers entirely.\n\n* ✅ Transfers are secured with always-on end-to-end encryption (TLS 1.3) and require no user accounts or exposure of personal information.\n\n* ✅ Leverages advanced networking techniques like QUIC hole punching for reliable NAT traversal and connectivity, even across complex networks.\n\n* ✅ The tool supports fully resumable downloads and transfers of files or directories of any size, verified using BLAKE3 integrity checks.\n\n* ✅ Seamless CLI interoperability allows developers to integrate secure, high-speed transfers directly into their automated workflows and scripts.\n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 2362\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 109\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 6\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ TypeScript\n\n\nTired of uploading massive files to a third-party server only to have the recipient download them again? If you're like me, you probably cringe every time you hit an arbitrary size limit on a cloud service, or worry about the privacy implications of handing over sensitive data to a corporate middleman just to share a folder with a colleague. This is where AltSendme steps in, offering a revolutionary, decentralized approach to file sharing that developers absolutely need to know about.\r\n\r\nAltSendme is a free, open-source file transfer tool designed to ditch the cloud intermediary entirely. Its core purpose is simple: facilitate direct, peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers between any two devices, regardless of where they are located—be it on your local network or across continents. Think of it as beaming a file directly from your computer to theirs, bypassing all the slow, restrictive upload/download queues of traditional services.\r\n\r\nThis efficiency and reliability is powered by cutting-edge P2P networking technology built on Iroh and utilizing QUIC. When you want to send a file, AltSendme generates a unique, secure \"ticket.\" This ticket acts like a temporary key that only the intended recipient can use. Instead of uploading the data to a server first, AltSendme uses sophisticated techniques like QUIC hole punching for NAT traversal. This means it can establish a direct, low-latency connection even if both devices are behind complex firewalls or routers. If a direct path isn't possible, it uses an encrypted relay fallback, ensuring the transfer always goes through securely and reliably.\r\n\r\nFor developers, the benefits are immense. First and foremost is the inherent security. Every transfer is protected with end-to-end encryption using QUIC + TLS 1.3, guaranteeing forward and backward secrecy. Because the data never touches a centralized server, you maintain complete control and privacy—no accounts, no sign-ups, and absolutely no personal information is ever exposed. This is critical for handling sensitive development assets or large proprietary datasets where data sovereignty matters.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, AltSendme is fast and robust. It’s capable of saturating multi-gigabit connections, making it lightning-fast for transferring large directories or massive datasets. If your connection drops mid-transfer, don't worry—the transfers are fully resumable, picking up exactly where they left off thanks to built-in integrity checks based on BLAKE3 hashing. This reliability is a game-changer for moving multi-terabyte projects. Plus, the seamless interoperability with the existing command-line interface (CLI) tools means you can generate tickets on the desktop app and use them instantly in your scripts, integrating secure transfers directly into your automated workflows. It’s time to move beyond the limitations of centralized file sharing and embrace the speed, security, and freedom of true P2P networking.\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/tonyantony300/alt-sendme)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
