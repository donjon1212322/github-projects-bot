It's built with TypeScript and Go, offering features like note-taking, knowledge base creation, and markdown support, with integrations for various services and tools.\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ SiYuan is an open-source, block-based knowledge management tool designed for structuring complex information.\n\n* ✅ It prioritizes data ownership by storing all notes locally, supporting synchronization via third-party services like Docker for self-hosting.\n\n* ✅ The AGPLv3 license allows developers complete freedom to inspect, modify, and extend the application to fit unique workflow needs.\n\n* ✅ Its block-based structure and powerful internal linking capabilities facilitate the creation of highly interconnected documentation and knowledge bases.\n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 39346\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 2429\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 404\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ TypeScript\n\n\nTired of note-taking applications that lock your valuable data behind proprietary cloud services and restrictive APIs? SiYuan steps in as a powerful, open-source solution designed to be the ultimate knowledge base where you truly own your thoughts. It’s not just another text editor; it’s a robust tool built from the ground up to help you structure, connect, and refine complex ideas, living up to its motto: \"Refactor your thinking.\"\n\nAt its core, SiYuan operates on a block-based architecture, similar to modern tools like Notion or Roam Research. This means every paragraph, code snippet, image, or formula is treated as an individual component, making organization, linking, and rearrangement incredibly flexible and powerful. This modular approach is excellent for developers who deal with structured information, documentation, and interconnected project notes. You can easily reference blocks across different documents, creating a dense, self-referential web of knowledge.\n\nCrucially, SiYuan prioritizes data ownership and portability. Unlike many cloud-first services, all your notes and data are stored locally on your device. This architecture is key because it gives you direct, unmediated control over your knowledge vault. Furthermore, it explicitly supports synchronization through third-party sync disks (like Dropbox or Google Drive), allowing you to maintain full control over the syncing mechanism without relying on the vendor's cloud.\n\nWhy should developers pay special attention to SiYuan? First, it is licensed under AGPLv3, meaning the source code is completely open for inspection, modification, and contribution. If you need a specific feature, a custom theme, or a deep integration, you have the freedom to build it yourself. This open nature fosters a strong community and ensures the tool remains adaptable to specialized developer workflows.\n\nSecond, the project offers fantastic deployment flexibility, including official Docker support. This is a massive benefit for developers and teams prioritizing privacy or seeking to run a robust, internal, self-hosted knowledge management system on their own infrastructure. Spinning up a private instance for team documentation or highly sensitive personal notes is straightforward and secure. The combination of local storage, open-source code, and Docker deployment transforms SiYuan from a simple note-taker into a foundational platform for sophisticated, privacy-focused knowledge management workflows. If you value control, extensibility, and the ability to tinker with your tools, SiYuan is a must-see.\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/siyuan-note/siyuan)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
