Ever wished there was a simpler, faster way to extract information from all those documents flooding your inbox?  I have some seriously exciting news: meet Kreuzberg, the Python document intelligence framework that's about to revolutionize how you handle PDFs, Word docs, images, and more!  Imagine a world where extracting text, metadata, and even structured table data from any document type is a breeze. That's the promise of Kreuzberg. It's built on top of powerful open-source tools like Pandoc, PDFium, and Tesseract, meaning it's robust, reliable, and incredibly efficient. Forget fiddling with multiple tools and libraries – Kreuzberg provides a unified, easy-to-use API for all your document processing needs.  Need to extract text from a PDF? Done. Want to grab metadata like the author or creation date?  No problem.  Need to recognize tables and their contents? Kreuzberg has you covered.  It even offers OCR capabilities, handling scanned documents or images with ease, using multiple OCR engines for optimal results.  The best part? It's blazing fast.  Seriously, the benchmarks are impressive – we're talking 30+ documents processed per second.  Kreuzberg's architecture is designed for efficiency.  The small installation size and minimal memory footprint make it perfect for any environment, from your local machine to a cloud-based server.  But it's not just about speed and efficiency.  Kreuzberg is also incredibly extensible.  Its plugin architecture lets you easily add custom extractors to handle specialized document formats or extract specific data points that are important to your workflow. Whether you are building a web application or a command-line tool, Kreuzberg's asynchronous and synchronous APIs provide consistent interfaces.  The entire codebase is type-annotated, so you get the benefits of type safety and enhanced code readability.  Think of the time you'll save, not having to write custom solutions for each document type you encounter.  Plus, the consistent API means less time debugging and more time building amazing things.  Kreuzberg is also incredibly easy to integrate into your existing projects.  The CLI makes quick experimentation a snap, and the Python library seamlessly integrates into any Python workflow.  There's even a Docker image for easy deployment!  Want to give it a try? The documentation is top-notch, and there's a vibrant community ready to help you get started.  Seriously, check out the benchmarks; you'll be amazed by the speed.  If you're tired of wrestling with document processing, Kreuzberg is the solution you've been waiting for.
