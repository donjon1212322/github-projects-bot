This allows users to maintain privacy and reduce distractions while still being able to interact with the hidden applications. It offers both a graphical user interface (GUI) and a command-line interface (CLI) for managing window visibility.\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ Hides windows from screen sharing and taskbar without minimizing them.\n\n* ✅ Offers both a user-friendly GUI and a powerful CLI.\n\n* ✅ Uses DLL injection for seamless integration with target applications.\n\n* ✅ Improves workflow by eliminating the need for manual window management.\n\n* ✅ Well-documented and actively maintained, making it a great learning resource.\n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 31\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 0\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 1\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ C++\n\n\nEver been in a meeting where you need to keep something on your screen private, but screen sharing is unavoidable?  Or wished you could quickly hide a window from your taskbar without minimizing it?  Meet WinHider, a fantastic GitHub project that solves precisely these problems!  It's a lightweight application that lets you discreetly hide windows from both screen sharing tools (like Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet) and the taskbar/task switcher.  The best part? You can still interact with the hidden application as if it were visible, making it ideal for maintaining privacy during presentations or multitasking without distractions.\n\nWinHider works using a clever technique of DLL injection.  For those unfamiliar, DLL injection is a way to inject code into a running process.  In this case, WinHider injects small DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries) into the target application's process. These DLLs modify the window's properties, making it invisible to screen sharing applications and the taskbar.  Think of it like applying a temporary invisibility cloak to your window!  The magic happens through manipulating Windows API functions like `SetWindowDisplayAffinity` to exclude the window from screen captures and modifying its extended window styles to remove it from the taskbar.\n\nBut the brilliance of WinHider doesn't stop at its functionality.  It offers both a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) and a command-line interface (CLI).  The GUI is perfect for quick, everyday use, allowing you to select windows with a few clicks.  The CLI, on the other hand, is a power user's dream, enabling scripting and automation for advanced scenarios.  Imagine creating a custom script to automatically hide sensitive windows before a presentation – that's the kind of control WinHider provides.\n\nFor developers, WinHider's benefits are substantial. It saves time by eliminating the need to manually minimize or close windows, preventing accidental exposure of sensitive information during screen sharing. It improves workflow by allowing seamless multitasking without the visual clutter of unnecessary windows.  The project's code is well-structured and documented, making it a great example of clean and efficient Windows programming. Plus, it's actively maintained and updated, ensuring continued support and compatibility.\n\nWinHider's simplicity and effectiveness are its strongest assets.  It's a tool that addresses a common problem faced by developers and non-developers alike, offering a clean and efficient solution.  The project's versatility, with both GUI and CLI options, caters to a wide range of users, from casual users to seasoned developers looking for automation capabilities.  The ability to integrate WinHider into existing workflows via scripting further enhances its value. It's a must-have tool for anyone who values their privacy and efficiency while working on Windows.\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/aamitn/winhider)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
