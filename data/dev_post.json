Meet **lume**, the macOS and Linux VM manager that's about to revolutionize your workflow!  This powerful command-line interface (CLI) and local API server makes spinning up and interacting with VMs incredibly simple, even for complex setups.  Forget wrestling with lengthy configuration files and cryptic commands; lume streamlines the entire process.  Built using Apple's `Virtualization.Framework`, lume delivers near-native performance on Apple Silicon, ensuring your VMs run smoothly and efficiently.  Need to run a pre-built macOS image?  It's as easy as typing `lume run macos-sequoia-vanilla:latest`. One line, one command, and you're ready to go!  Beyond the simplicity, lume offers a comprehensive set of commands.  You can create new VMs with custom configurations (CPU cores, memory, disk size, and more), list existing VMs, get detailed information about each VM, stop and start VMs, and even clone them.  Need to manage your disk images? lume handles that too, with commands to pull images from a container registry, manage local cache, and even get the latest macOS restore image URL.  For those who prefer a more programmatic approach, lume also has a Python interface, pylume, offering even greater flexibility and integration into existing workflows.  The local API server allows for seamless integration with other tools and automation scripts, making lume a versatile addition to your development arsenal.  Imagine the possibilities: automated testing environments, effortless development across different operating systems, or quickly setting up isolated environments for specific projects.  lume is not just a VM manager; it's a productivity booster. Its intuitive design, powerful features, and exceptional performance make it an essential tool for any developer working with macOS or Linux VMs on Apple Silicon.  The project is actively maintained and has a vibrant community, ready to assist you with any questions or issues you might encounter.  Dive in and experience the future of VM management today!\n\n## Learn More: üîó\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/trycua/lume)\n\n---\nüåü **Enjoyed this project?** Get a daily dose of awesome open-source discoveries by following [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source) on Telegram! ‚ú®",
