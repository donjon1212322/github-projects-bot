It allows users to define workflows using a simple YAML schema, manage process dependencies, and execute processes in parallel or serially. It offers features such as health checks, a TUI, and a REST API, providing a comprehensive solution for managing applications without Docker.\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ Simplified management of non-containerized applications.\n\n* ✅ Intuitive YAML configuration similar to docker-compose.\n\n* ✅ Rich feature set including process recovery, environment variables, and a TUI.\n\n* ✅ Improved workflow efficiency and reduced risk of errors.\n\n* ✅ Easy installation and portability.\n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 1755\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 78\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 30\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ Go\n\n\nTired of wrestling with Dockerfiles and container complexities just to run a simple application?  Then get ready to meet Process Compose – a game-changer for managing non-containerized apps!  This fantastic Go-based project lets you orchestrate your applications with ease, using a simple YAML configuration file.  Think of it as a lightweight, streamlined version of docker-compose, but without the container overhead.  It's perfect for those times when you just want to get your application up and running without the added complexity of containers.  \n\nProcess Compose's magic lies in its intuitive YAML configuration. You define your processes, their dependencies, and startup order in a clear, readable format.  Need one process to finish before another starts? No problem! Process Compose handles the dependencies for you. Want to run multiple instances of a process? It's got you covered.  The configuration file is remarkably similar to docker-compose's format, making the transition incredibly smooth for those familiar with the concept.  \n\nBut the benefits extend far beyond simple process management. Process Compose offers a rich feature set including process recovery policies, per-process environment variables, and even a slick terminal user interface (TUI) for monitoring your applications.  Imagine being able to easily restart processes, view logs in real-time, and manage your entire application workflow from a single, elegant interface.  The TUI is particularly impressive; it provides a clear, concise overview of your running processes, allowing for quick identification and resolution of any issues.  \n\nProcess Compose also supports process arguments using bash or zsh style syntax, simplifying the way you pass parameters to your applications.  It handles global and per-process environment variables, making configuration flexible and straightforward.  Furthermore, its built-in logging capabilities are a significant advantage, providing a centralized and organized view of your application's activity.  The project also boasts a REST API, enabling integration with other systems and tools, and supports log caching and configurable shortcuts.  \n\nFor developers, the advantages are numerous.  It simplifies the deployment and management of non-containerized applications, saving time and effort.  The intuitive YAML configuration and powerful features eliminate the need for complex scripting and manual intervention, ultimately improving workflow efficiency and reducing the risk of errors.  The single binary file nature of Process Compose ensures easy installation and portability across different systems, eliminating dependency headaches.  Whether you're working on a small personal project or a large-scale enterprise application, Process Compose can significantly streamline your development process.  The ease of use and powerful features make it a must-have tool for any developer's arsenal.  Seriously, check it out! You won't regret it.\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/F1bonacc1/process-compose)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
