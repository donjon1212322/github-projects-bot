It offers comprehensive features for hiding processes, files, and network connections, alongside capabilities for privilege escalation, log sanitization, and evasion of various detection mechanisms like eBPF tools and EDRs.\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ Singularity demonstrates state-of-the-art kernel evasion using ftrace system call hooking rather than traditional, easily detectable methods.\n\n* ✅ It actively bypasses modern security tools, including eBPF monitors (like Falco/Tracee) and the Linux Kernel Runtime Guard (LKRG).\n\n* ✅ The rootkit employs advanced anti-forensics by filtering critical kernel data files such as /proc/kcore and /proc/kallsyms to evade memory analysis.\n\n* ✅ Analyzing the techniques used by Singularity is essential for security developers building next-generation kernel defense and EDR solutions.\n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 1264\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 142\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 0\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ C\n\n\nHave you ever wondered just how deep a threat actor can bury themselves inside a modern Linux system? When we talk about security, most defensive tools focus on user-space monitoring, but the real battleground is often the kernel itself. A project called Singularity serves as a stark, powerful example of what advanced kernel-level malware looks like today. It’s not just a simple module; it’s a masterclass in evasion, designed specifically to bypass the latest and greatest defensive technologies, including sophisticated EDRs and eBPF-based security tools like Falco and Tracee. Understanding how a threat like this operates is absolutely critical for anyone serious about system defense and kernel hardening.\r\n\r\nSingularity operates as a Linux Kernel Module (LKM), meaning it lives alongside the operating system's core functions. Its primary weapon is system call hooking, which it achieves using the ftrace infrastructure. Instead of crudely patching the kernel memory, it leverages legitimate kernel tracing mechanisms to intercept and modify system behavior. For example, when a defender runs a command to list processes or check network connections, Singularity intercepts those calls and filters out any hidden entries in real-time. This sophisticated filtering extends deeply into the system, allowing it to conceal files, processes, and even block audit messages before they reach the system journal or auditd.\r\n\r\nWhat makes this project truly fascinating—and frightening—is its focus on anti-forensics and anti-detection. It actively targets modern defensive layers. For instance, it implements filtering for /proc/kcore and /proc/kallsyms, which are essential files used by memory forensics tools like Volatility to analyze the kernel state. By sanitizing these outputs, it attempts to blind investigators completely. Furthermore, it explicitly targets evasion techniques against eBPF security tools and even the Linux Kernel Runtime Guard (LKRG), demonstrating a profound understanding of kernel defense mechanisms. This level of comprehensive evasion shows that modern kernel threats must be designed not just to hide, but to anticipate and neutralize specific detection methods.\r\n\r\nFor developers focused on security, kernel engineering, or incident response, studying the architecture of tools like Singularity is an invaluable educational exercise. It reveals the necessary blind spots and points of weakness that next-generation security tools must address. If an LKM can leverage ftrace for undetectable hooking, how can we monitor ftrace usage itself? If it filters Netlink messages, how do we establish a trusted, out-of-band communication channel for telemetry? This project provides a blueprint for advanced threats, and by analyzing it, we gain the crucial knowledge needed to build stronger, more resilient kernel defenses. This is the ultimate defensive homework assignment for anyone serious about protecting Linux infrastructure.\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/MatheuZSecurity/Singularity)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
