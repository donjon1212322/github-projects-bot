It simplifies container management by offering features like one-click access, automatic port mapping, live logs, Traefik integration, multi-host management, and image update checks.\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ Dockpeek is a self-hosted, zero-configuration Docker dashboard offering centralized control and monitoring.\n\n* ✅ It provides one-click web access, live log streaming, and automatic detection of published ports and Traefik labels.\n\n* ✅ The dashboard includes integrated image update checks, notifying you when newer container versions are available.\n\n* ✅ It supports multi-host management, allowing control over multiple Docker daemons from a single interface.\n\n* ✅ Customization is available via Docker container labels for linking, tagging, and display control.\n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 1413\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 53\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 10\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ JavaScript\n\n\nAre you tired of jumping back and forth between SSH sessions and command line interfaces just to check the status or logs of your running Docker containers? If your self-hosted stack or development environment is growing, managing everything manually quickly becomes tedious and inefficient. That’s where Dockpeek steps in, offering a breath of fresh air as a centralized, intuitive control panel for your entire container ecosystem.\n\nDockpeek is designed to be incredibly lightweight and simple to set up. Think of it as a mission control for your containers. Once deployed (usually via a simple Docker Compose file), it immediately connects to your Docker daemon and starts collecting data. The brilliance lies in its automatic detection capabilities. It doesn't require complex configuration files; it simply reads the metadata—like published ports and container names—directly from Docker. This zero-configuration approach means you spend less time setting up and more time managing.\n\nOne of the standout features is how Dockpeek handles connectivity. It automatically provides one-click access to any container with a web interface. If you are using Traefik, Dockpeek is smart enough to read those routing labels and automatically provide the correct service URLs, eliminating the guesswork involved in figuring out which IP and port combination corresponds to which service. This level of integration is a huge time-saver for anyone running a reverse proxy setup.\n\nBeyond easy access, Dockpeek dramatically simplifies diagnostics and maintenance. You can stream live container logs directly in the web interface, which is far more convenient than tailing logs in a terminal. Furthermore, keeping your stack secure and up-to-date is streamlined: Dockpeek actively checks image registries and alerts you when a newer version of an image is available. With a few clicks, you can identify and plan updates, moving away from the \"set it and forget it\" mentality that often leads to vulnerabilities.\n\nFor developers managing complex infrastructure or multiple remote machines, Dockpeek offers multi-host management, allowing you to control several Docker daemons from a single dashboard. This is crucial for distributed applications or development teams needing visibility across various environments. Additionally, advanced users can leverage Docker labels to customize the dashboard further—adding custom tags for organization, controlling port grouping visibility, or ensuring specific links default to HTTPS. Dockpeek transforms the often-cluttered world of container management into a clean, efficient, and accessible experience, making it an essential tool in any modern developer’s toolkit.\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/dockpeek/dockpeek)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
