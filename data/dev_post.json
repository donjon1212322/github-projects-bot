It can read and edit code, execute shell commands, fetch web content, and autonomously plan actions, integrating with various IDEs and shells.\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ Kimi Code CLI is an autonomous AI agent embedded directly in the terminal, capable of complex, multi-step software development tasks.\n\n* ✅ It eliminates context switching by handling code editing, shell execution, web searches, and autonomous planning within a single session.\n\n* ✅ The dedicated Shell Command Mode allows developers to execute manual terminal commands instantly without breaking the agent's context.\n\n* ✅ The agent offers seamless integration with VS Code and supports the Agent Client Protocol (ACP) for use in IDEs like Zed and JetBrains.\n\n* ✅ By automating repetitive tasks, Kimi Code CLI significantly accelerates refactoring, debugging, and general development workflows.\n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 6343\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 597\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 38\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ Python\n\n\nWe all know the grind: you’re deep in the terminal, you need to check documentation, you switch to the browser, then back to the IDE, and finally back to the CLI to run a test. This constant context switching is a massive productivity killer. That’s exactly the problem Kimi Code CLI is designed to solve. This project isn't just another language model wrapper; it's an intelligent, autonomous agent that lives right inside your terminal, making it your ultimate development companion.\r\n\r\nKimi Code CLI functions as a powerful, context-aware shell. When you give it a task—say, \"Refactor the logging logic in `main.py` and ensure all unit tests pass\"—it doesn't just spit out code. Instead, it autonomously plans a series of actions. It can read your existing files to understand the current state, search the web for relevant documentation if needed, execute shell commands (like `git status` or `pip install`), and then apply the necessary code edits. If the first attempt fails or a command returns an error, Kimi automatically adjusts its plan and tries again, mimicking a human developer's debugging process.\r\n\r\nOne of the most impressive features is its dedicated Shell Command Mode, accessible instantly via `Ctrl-X`. This means you never have to leave the AI session to run a quick, manual command. You switch modes, execute your command (like checking a specific log file output), and switch back. The agent retains full context of what you just did, ensuring seamless continuity in your workflow. This is crucial for maintaining flow and preventing the mental overhead of juggling multiple terminal windows or applications.\r\n\r\nBeyond the raw CLI, Kimi is incredibly versatile in how you integrate it into your development environment. It offers a ready-made VS Code extension for those who prefer their editor interface. More importantly, it supports the Agent Client Protocol (ACP) out of the box. This means if you use modern IDEs like Zed or JetBrains, you can configure Kimi Code CLI as an ACP agent server. You get the full power of the autonomous agent running in the background, accessible directly from your IDE's agent panel, allowing you to bridge the power of the terminal agent with the comfort of your graphical editor.\r\n\r\nWhy should developers immediately integrate this? Simply put, Kimi Code CLI automates the tedious, multi-step administrative tasks that consume huge chunks of your time. Instead of spending 30 minutes manually identifying, replacing, and testing deprecated functions across multiple files, you delegate the entire workflow to Kimi with a single, conversational prompt. It saves time, minimizes errors from manual context switching, and allows you to focus your intellectual energy on high-level architectural challenges rather than repetitive command-line mechanics. This is the future of terminal interaction, and it’s available right now.\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-cli)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
