Seamlessly Convert Telegram Sessions Between Telethon and Pyrogram with TGConvertor\npublished: True\ntags: telegram, pyrogram, telethon, session\n---\n\n## Quick Summary: 📝\nNone\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ TGConvertor enables seamless, re-authentication-free conversion of Telegram sessions between Telethon, Pyrogram, Kurigram, and Tdata formats.\n\n* ✅ It works by extracting the core, universal authorization key and rebuilding the session structure for the target library format.\n\n* ✅ The project offers both a simple command-line interface (CLI) and a flexible Python API for scripting and integration.\n\n* ✅ It significantly improves developer workflow when migrating projects or testing across different Telegram Python libraries.\n\n* ✅ Supports specifying API types (desktop, mobile, web) during conversion for enhanced compatibility across various client versions.\n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 100\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 28\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 0\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ Python\n\n\nIf you've ever built a sophisticated Telegram bot or automation script, you know the pain of vendor lock-in, especially when it comes to session files. Switching from Telethon to Pyrogram, or vice versa, usually means manually re-authenticating your account, which is tedious and time-consuming, especially if you manage multiple accounts. This is where TGConvertor steps in as the ultimate workflow savior, eliminating the need to constantly log in again just because you changed libraries. It’s a game-changer for multi-library Telegram development.\n\nTGConvertor is a brilliant, small utility designed specifically to solve this session incompatibility nightmare. It acts as a universal translator for Telegram authorization data, allowing you to fluidly move your session credentials between major Python libraries like Telethon and Pyrogram, and even the native Telegram Desktop format, Tdata. This means zero downtime and zero re-authentication when migrating your tools or experimenting with a new library.\n\nThe magic behind TGConvertor is surprisingly straightforward. A Telegram session is fundamentally built around a universal authorization key and some necessary connection metadata. Instead of trying to read one library's proprietary file format directly into another, TGConvertor strips away the packaging. It extracts this core, universal authorization data and then uses it to construct a perfectly valid session file tailored for your chosen destination format—be it a Pyrogram `.session` file or a Tdata directory structure. This process is handled efficiently by the `SessionManager`, making the conversion reliable and fast.\n\nDevelopers should absolutely care about this tool because of the massive flexibility it provides. Whether you prefer the simplicity of the command-line interface (CLI) for quick, one-off conversions, or you need to integrate session management directly into your Python scripts using the powerful API, TGConvertor handles it all. Need to test if your existing Telethon session works better under Pyrogram? One simple command handles the conversion. Even cooler, it supports converting sessions to and from the Tdata format, opening up possibilities for integrating official desktop client sessions into your automation projects. Furthermore, you can specify the API type (desktop, android, iOS) during conversion, ensuring maximum compatibility for specialized use cases. This is not just a tool; it's a massive productivity boost for anyone serious about Telegram automation who values flexibility and speed.\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/nazar220160/TGConvertor)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
