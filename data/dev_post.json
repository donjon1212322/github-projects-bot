It offers powerful traffic filtering, advanced analysis capabilities through aggregated packet metrics, and in-depth kernel-level latency details. Kyanos aims to simplify network troubleshooting by providing a lightweight, dependency-free solution.\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ Single binary, easy setup and use.\n\n* ✅ Powerful filtering by various dimensions (PID, container ID, L7 protocols, etc.).\n\n* ✅ Advanced analysis: aggregated metrics, clear overview of network performance.\n\n* ✅ In-depth kernel-level latency details for precise bottleneck identification.\n\n* ✅ Automatic SSL handling for seamless analysis of encrypted traffic.  \n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 3980\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 143\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 36\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ C\n\n\nDive into Kyanos: Your New Best Friend for Network Troubleshooting! Ever spent hours wrestling with slow network requests, wishing you had a magic wand to pinpoint the culprit?  Kyanos is that magic wand. This incredible eBPF-based tool lets you capture and analyze network traffic with unparalleled ease and speed. Forget sifting through endless logs; Kyanos gives you the insights you need in seconds.  It's like having X-ray vision for your network! \n\nSo, what makes Kyanos so special? First off, its simplicity. It's a single binary file—no complex setup or dependencies required. Just download, run, and you're ready to go. This is a huge time saver compared to traditional methods that involve multiple tools and configurations.  The command-line interface is intuitive and easy to master, even for developers who aren't network gurus. \n\nSecondly, Kyanos offers powerful filtering capabilities.  Need to isolate requests from a specific process, container, or even based on L7 protocol information (like HTTP or Redis)?  No problem!  Kyanos lets you filter by process ID, container ID, specific keys (in Redis, for example), response byte size, latency, and much more. This precision targeting allows you to focus on the relevant traffic, ignoring the noise, and quickly zeroing in on the source of the problem. \n\nThirdly, and this is where Kyanos really shines, its advanced analysis capabilities.  It goes far beyond simple packet capture.  It aggregates metrics across various dimensions, giving you a clear, concise overview of your network's performance.  Imagine your HTTP service suddenly maxing out bandwidth.  With Kyanos, you use a single command to find out which IPs and requests are consuming the most resources. It's that efficient! \n\nKyanos also provides in-depth kernel-level latency details.  Slow queries to remote services can be incredibly frustrating to debug.  Kyanos traces the request from arrival at the network card all the way to the kernel socket buffer, visually highlighting any bottlenecks.  This level of detail allows you to pinpoint the exact cause of delays, saving you countless hours of guesswork. \n\nFinally, Kyanos handles SSL traffic automatically.  No more fiddling with certificates or worrying about decryption; it just works.  This seamless integration makes it a truly comprehensive solution for network troubleshooting.  All of this, combined with its lightweight design and ease of use, makes Kyanos an indispensable tool for any developer working with network-intensive applications.  It's a game-changer for network performance analysis and debugging!\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/hengyoush/kyanos)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
