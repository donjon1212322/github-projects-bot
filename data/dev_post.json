It stores tasks as individual JSON files and uses Git or Jujutsu for version control, enabling collaboration, synchronization, and backup of tasks.\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ Manages tasks via a fast, TUI interface built with Bubble Tea, maximizing terminal efficiency.\n\n* ✅ Stores tasks as portable, readable JSON files on your local filesystem, ensuring data transparency and control.\n\n* ✅ Integrates deeply with Git/Jujutsu, committing every change for full version history and easy rollback capabilities.\n\n* ✅ Enables seamless synchronization and collaboration across machines using standard VCS remotes, eliminating proprietary sync issues.\n\n* ✅ Supports essential developer features like Markdown notes, project organization, and extensive theme customization.\n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 64\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 4\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 1\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ Go\n\n\nAre you tired of jumping between your code editor and a web-based task manager just to update a simple to-do item? If you live in the terminal, you need a task manager that feels native to your workflow. That’s where yatto steps in. This isn't just another TUI application; it fundamentally changes how you think about task management by treating your to-dos like source code.\n\nYatto is built using the fantastic Bubble Tea framework, meaning it provides a fast, responsive, and visually appealing interface right in your terminal. You can navigate, create projects, and manage tasks using keyboard shortcuts, keeping your hands off the mouse and maximizing your focus. It brings the efficiency of TUI applications to personal organization.\n\nThe real magic, however, lies in how yatto handles data storage. Unlike systems that rely on proprietary databases or cloud services, yatto stores every single task as an individual JSON file directly on your filesystem. This approach offers incredible portability and transparency. You can inspect, backup, or even script against your tasks using standard tools because they are just simple, readable files.\n\nBut storing local files is only half the story. Yatto automatically initializes the task directory as a Git or Jujutsu repository. This is the game-changer for developers. Every time you make a modification\twhether you change a due date, add a label, or mark a task as \"in progress\"\tyatto immediately performs a commit. This gives you a complete, granular version history of your entire task list. Need to see exactly when you completed a step six months ago? Just check the commit log.\n\nFor remote teams or developers working across multiple machines, this VCS integration is invaluable. By setting up a remote repository (like GitHub or GitLab), you gain instant, robust synchronization and backup. Your tasks are now versioned and collaborative using the tools you already trust\tGit. No proprietary sync protocols, just standard distributed version control. This means safe collaboration, easy rollbacks, and the assurance that your data is securely mirrored.\n\nBeyond its innovative architecture, yatto offers great practical features. Tasks can be organized into projects, include searchable labels and due dates, and, crucially, support Markdown formatting for rich, detailed notes. You can also customize the themes and colors using lipgloss values, ensuring the application fits perfectly into your personalized terminal aesthetic. If you value control, transparency, and integrating task management seamlessly into a command-line environment, yatto is definitely worth adding to your toolkit.\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/handlebargh/yatto)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
