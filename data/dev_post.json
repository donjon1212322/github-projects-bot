And the simple Timer is there for those times you just need to keep track of how long something's taking.\n\nWhat makes `timr-tui` stand out is its flexibility.  You can customize the duration of your Pomodoro sessions, the length of your breaks, and even the visual style of the timer itself!  Want to add deciseconds for extra precision?  No problem.

Desktop notifications are also supported (though experimental), allowing you to stay on track without constantly staring at your terminal.  The developers have clearly thought of everything, making this a truly comprehensive time management solution for developers.\n\nIf you're tired of juggling multiple apps to manage your time while coding, `timr-tui` is a game-changer.
