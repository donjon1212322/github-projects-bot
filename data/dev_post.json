It aims to streamline tab management, making it easier to navigate and interact with a large number of open tabs.\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ Instantly search and switch between dozens of open tabs using the simple keyboard shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + Space.\n\n* ✅ UnTab provides a command-palette interface for managing tabs and performing actions without leaving the keyboard.\n\n* ✅ Boosts developer productivity by significantly reducing context switching and visual search time.\n\n* ✅ The extension is open source and prioritizes user privacy by processing all tab data locally without sending information to a server.\n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 377\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 25\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 14\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ JavaScript\n\n\nIf you're anything like me, your browser window is a constant battlefield of tabs. We open them for research, debugging, documentation, and before we know it, we're squinting at tiny favicons trying to find that one crucial piece of information. This is where UnTab steps in, transforming that chaotic tab bar into a streamlined, searchable command palette. It's the productivity boost you didn't know you needed, turning a tedious task into a quick keyboard shortcut that makes you feel like a browser wizard.\n\nUnTab works by providing a lightning-fast overlay accessible via the powerful shortcut, `Ctrl + Shift + Space`. Think of it like Spotlight on Mac or the Command Palette in VS Code, but specifically tailored for your browser workflow. When the overlay pops up, you can instantly start typing to filter through all your currently open tabs. Finding that specific Stack Overflow answer or documentation page becomes instantaneous, eliminating the need for endless clicking and frustrating visual scanning across dozens of tabs.\n\nBeyond simple searching, UnTab gives you the ability to manage those tabs efficiently. You can quickly switch to a tab, close it, or even perform common browser actions right from the palette, all without taking your hands off the keyboard. This keyboard-centric approach is a massive time saver, especially for developers who thrive on efficiency and hate the friction of context switching. The project is built using Svelte for the UI components, which contributes to its snappy performance and modern feel, making it a joy to integrate into your daily routine.\n\nFor developers, UnTab offers a significant quality-of-life improvement. By centralizing tab management, it drastically reduces cognitive load. Instead of remembering where a tab is located in a long strip, you only need to remember a fragment of its title or URL. Furthermore, UnTab respects your privacy deeply; it processes all your data, including tabs, history, and bookmarks, locally and explicitly states that it does not store or send anything to a server. This commitment to privacy is crucial in a world where browser extensions often overreach, giving you peace of mind while boosting your efficiency across Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/blenderskool/untab)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
