It uses agents to collect data from endpoints, which is then analyzed by a central server. Wazuh integrates with the Elastic Stack for data visualization and offers features like intrusion detection, log analysis, file integrity monitoring, vulnerability detection, configuration assessment, and incident response.\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ Wazuh simplifies security monitoring with its agent-server architecture.\n\n* ✅ It offers proactive threat detection using signature-based analysis and file integrity monitoring.\n\n* ✅ Seamless integration with the Elastic Stack provides beautiful data visualization.\n\n* ✅ It automates incident response, minimizing damage and downtime.\n\n* ✅ Wazuh is open source, free to use, and highly customizable.\n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 12687\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 1876\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 2643\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ C\n\n\nHey fellow developers! Ever wished for a security superhero to watch over your systems, alerting you to threats before they cause havoc?  Meet Wazuh, the open-source platform that's changing the game in threat detection and response!  Forget complex configurations and cryptic alerts; Wazuh makes security monitoring surprisingly straightforward.\n\nAt its core, Wazuh is a two-part system: agents and a central server.  Imagine tiny security sentinels (the agents) deployed on each of your servers, applications, or containers. These agents constantly monitor for suspicious activity, collecting logs and system data.  They then send this data to the central Wazuh server, which is like Mission Control, analyzing the information using powerful rules and algorithms.\n\nThe Wazuh server isn't just a passive observer; it actively hunts for threats using signature-based detection. Think of it as a highly trained cybersecurity analyst, instantly recognizing known attack patterns and vulnerabilities. But Wazuh goes beyond simple pattern matching.  It also performs file integrity monitoring, making sure no one tampers with critical system files. It even checks for known vulnerabilities in your software, alerting you to potential weaknesses before they're exploited.\n\nOne of Wazuh's coolest features is its seamless integration with the Elastic Stack (ELK).  This means you can visualize all your security data in beautiful dashboards, making it easy to spot trends and anomalies.  No more wading through endless log files – Wazuh and ELK give you a clear, concise picture of your security posture.  And if a threat is detected, Wazuh can even automatically take action, such as blocking malicious connections or isolating infected systems.  This proactive approach minimizes damage and speeds up incident response.\n\nWhat's in it for you, the developer?  Wazuh saves you countless hours of manual security monitoring.  It simplifies compliance with security regulations, providing the necessary audit trails and reports.  It helps you build more secure applications, identifying vulnerabilities early in the development process.  Plus, it's open source, meaning it's free to use, highly customizable, and backed by a vibrant community of developers.\n\nWazuh is more than just a security tool; it's a powerful platform that empowers developers to build and maintain secure systems.  It's time to stop worrying about security vulnerabilities and start focusing on building amazing applications!\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
