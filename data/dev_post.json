It supports a wide range of file formats (250+) including images, audio, documents, and video, with conversion settings and a user-friendly Svelte interface.\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ VERT performs file conversions locally in the browser using WebAssembly, ensuring maximum data privacy.\n\n* ✅ The project supports over 250 file formats (images, audio, documents, video) without file size limitations.\n\n* ✅ Conversion speed is dependent only on the user's device, eliminating cloud upload/download bottlenecks.\n\n* ✅ Built with modern technologies (Svelte and TypeScript) for a fast and intuitive user experience.\n\n* ✅ The project is open source (AGPL-3.0), promoting transparency and self-hosting options.\n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 7119\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 308\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 14\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ Svelte\n\n\nWe've all been there: you need to quickly convert a file, so you head to an online converter, click upload, and wait. But every time you hit that upload button, you’re handing over potentially sensitive data to a third-party server, often constrained by frustrating file size limits and slow transfer speeds. This common workflow is a huge bottleneck for efficiency and a major risk for privacy. What if the conversion could happen instantly, without your data ever leaving your machine?\n\nThat’s the core brilliance of VERT.sh. This project completely flips the traditional file conversion model on its head. Instead of relying on cloud infrastructure, VERT leverages the power of WebAssembly (Wasm) to perform complex, high-performance conversions right in your browser. WebAssembly allows near-native code execution safely within the web environment, turning your browser into a powerful, client-side conversion engine.\n\nBecause the heavy lifting is done locally, the benefits for developers and everyday users are immediate and significant. Crucially, there are zero file size limits imposed by the service. You can convert massive documents, huge audio files, or high-resolution images without worrying about upload caps or bandwidth restrictions. Your file processing speed is only limited by the power of your own device, which is usually much faster than waiting for a slow public server.\n\nVERT supports an incredible variety of formats—over 250+—covering images, audio, documents, and video. It’s a truly universal conversion tool. The frontend is built using Svelte and TypeScript, offering a modern, snappy, and user-friendly interface that feels great to use. This combination of modern tooling and Wasm performance is a fantastic example of what the decentralized web can achieve.\n\nFor developers looking at the architecture, the commitment to privacy is absolute. Your files remain on your device throughout the entire process. Furthermore, while the official instance handles some video conversions via an easily self-hostable daemon, the core functionality remains rooted in client-side processing. Being AGPL-licensed, VERT invites inspection and collaboration, allowing us to build powerful tools that prioritize user control and data security. If you value privacy, performance, and open-source excellence, VERT.sh is definitely the next project you need to star on GitHub.\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/VERT-sh/VERT)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
