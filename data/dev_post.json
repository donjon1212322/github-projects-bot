It enables users to stream from various sources, transcode on-the-fly, and publish to popular streaming services, making it suitable for smart home integration and standalone use.\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ go2rtc acts as a universal video stream translator, converting inputs (RTSP, RTMP, HomeKit) to outputs (WebRTC, HLS, RTSP).\n\n* ✅ It delivers near \"zero-delay\" low-latency streaming performance, making it ideal for real-time monitoring applications.\n\n* ✅ The project features on-the-fly transcoding via integrated FFmpeg, solving common codec incompatibility issues automatically.\n\n* ✅ It is a lightweight, zero-dependency binary that is easy to deploy across all major operating systems and architectures.\n\n* ✅ Native support for complex sources, including HomeKit cameras, significantly expands integration capabilities for developers.\n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 10330\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 764\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 492\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ Go\n\n\nHave you ever tried setting up a home camera system or integrating different IP cameras into a single dashboard? It’s often a nightmare of incompatible protocols\b\bRTSP here, proprietary HTTP streams there, and WebRTC somewhere else. Dealing with codecs, latency, and transcoding usually means wrangling complex tools like FFmpeg manually. This fragmentation and complexity create a massive headache for developers trying to build reliable, unified video solutions.\n\nThis is where go2rtc steps in, acting as the ultimate middleware or \"universal translator\" for video streams. Its core purpose is simple: take video input from *any* source and output it in *any* required format, all with incredibly low latency. Think of it as a central hub for all your video feeds, regardless of whether they speak RTSP, RTMP, or even the challenging HomeKit protocol. The best part? It’s a single, small, zero-dependency binary that runs everywhere\b\rWindows, Linux, macOS, and ARM devices.\n\nHow does it achieve this magic? go2rtc is built to handle multiple simultaneous input and output protocols seamlessly. When a client requests a stream (say, via WebRTC for zero-delay viewing), go2rtc intelligently pulls the feed from the source (e.g., an old RTSP camera). If the codecs don't match what the client supports, go2rtc leverages its built-in FFmpeg capabilities to perform on-the-fly transcoding, ensuring seamless compatibility without requiring manual configuration. It’s also smart enough to mix tracks from different sources or handle complex 2-way audio negotiation for interactive camera features like speakers.\n\nFor developers, the benefits are huge. First, you get drastically reduced complexity. Instead of integrating multiple libraries to handle various protocols, you just point everything to go2rtc. Second, performance is a major win. The project emphasizes \"zero-delay\" streaming, which is absolutely crucial for security monitoring or real-time applications where every millisecond counts. Third, its native support for specialized sources, like being the first project to stream reliably from HomeKit cameras, opens up entirely new integration possibilities. Whether you're building a smart home platform, a custom security dashboard, or a live streaming service, go2rtc simplifies the video pipeline dramatically, letting you focus on your application logic rather than fighting protocol battles. Its deployment is trivial, ready to go via Docker or as a standalone binary, making this a must-have tool in your video toolkit.\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/AlexxIT/go2rtc)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
