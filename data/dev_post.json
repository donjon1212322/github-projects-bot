It helps with presence detection, network analysis, and building a network source of truth (NSoT) through scheduled scans and customizable plugins.\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ NetAlertX provides comprehensive network visibility, maintaining a reliable Network Source of Truth (NSoT) for all connected devices.\n\n* ✅ It features proactive alerting for unknown devices, connection changes, and IP shifts, significantly enhancing network security.\n\n* ✅ The tool enables robust and reliable device presence detection, crucial for advanced home automation systems.\n\n* ✅ Developers can easily extend functionality using the flexible plugin system, which handles UI generation and notification integration automatically.\n\n* ✅ It is easily deployable via Docker or as a Home Assistant add-on, making professional-grade network monitoring accessible to enthusiasts.\n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 4906\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 285\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 27\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ JavaScript\n\n\nAre you tired of playing detective whenever your home network acts up, or when a new, unknown device suddenly pops up on your Wi-Fi? In the age of smart homes and endless IoT gadgets, keeping track of everything connected to your router can feel like a full-time job. This is exactly the headache that NetAlertX is built to eliminate. It’s essentially your personal network security guard and presence detection expert, rolled into one slick, open-source package, giving you total visibility into your local area network (LAN).\r\n\r\nNetAlertX works by constantly monitoring your network and establishing a reliable Network Source of Truth (NSoT). It doesn't just passively listen; it actively scans for changes. Using multiple scanning methods, including robust tools like arp-scan and integrations with common services like Pi-hole or generic DHCP leases, NetAlertX builds a comprehensive map of every device—known and unknown. Think of it as an inventory system that updates itself in near real-time, ensuring you always know who and what is connected.\r\n\r\nThe core power lies in its scheduling and alerting framework. You can schedule regular checks to monitor for new devices connecting, existing devices disconnecting, or even subtle changes like a device's IP address shifting. If NetAlertX spots something unusual—like an unknown smartphone joining your guest network, or a crucial server suddenly going offline—it immediately triggers an alert. This proactive approach means you can react instantly to potential security breaches or operational failures, rather than discovering them hours or days later when the damage is already done.\r\n\r\nFor developers and advanced users, the customizability is a massive win. NetAlertX offers a robust plugin system. If you need a specialized scanner, a unique monitoring metric, or a specific integration point, you can write your own plugin quickly. The best part? The system handles the heavy lifting for you, including auto-generating the necessary user interface components and integrating with the built-in notification system. This dramatically lowers the barrier to extending its functionality and tailoring it precisely to your unique network environment, whether you are integrating it into Home Assistant or running it standalone via Docker.\r\n\r\nWhy should you check this out? Beyond the immediate security benefits of spotting intruders, NetAlertX simplifies complex automation scenarios. Reliable presence detection—knowing definitively whether your phone, laptop, or car is home—is crucial for triggering smart home routines, and this tool provides that stability. It saves countless hours that would otherwise be spent manually debugging network issues or building brittle custom scanning scripts. It transforms network monitoring from a chore into an automated, reliable process, giving you peace of mind and full visibility over your digital landscape with minimal effort.\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/jokob-sk/NetAlertX)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
