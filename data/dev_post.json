It acts as a safety net, preventing accidental or malicious actions in the terminal. Shellfirm supports various shells and allows customization of risky command patterns.\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ Prevents accidental data loss from risky terminal commands.\n\n* ✅ Easy setup and integration with various shells.\n\n* ✅ Adds a layer of security without impacting workflow.\n\n* ✅ Promotes better coding habits and reduces errors.\n\n* ✅ Lightweight and unobtrusive\n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 840\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 25\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 0\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ Rust\n\n\nEver accidentally deleted a crucial file with `rm -rf`? Or wiped your Git history with a reckless `git reset --hard`?  Yeah, we've all been there.  That sinking feeling in your stomach when you realize the irreversible damage you've done?  Shellfirm is here to rescue you from your own impulsive coding moments! This amazing GitHub project acts like a safety net for your terminal, preventing those dreaded 'oops' moments that can cost you hours, or even days, of work. \n\nShellfirm works by intercepting potentially risky commands before they execute.  Think of it as a super-powered, terminal-based CAPTCHA.  If it detects a command that could cause significant damage (like deleting a directory tree or resetting your Git repository), it pauses and prompts you to solve a simple math problem or confirm your action. This tiny pause is all it takes to give you a moment of reflection before you unleash havoc on your project.  It’s a small step to prevent a huge disaster. \n\nThe setup is straightforward.  Whether you're a Bash, Zsh, Fish, or even using Docker, Shellfirm provides easy-to-follow instructions to integrate it into your workflow.  It's a breeze to install via Homebrew or by downloading the binary directly.  Once installed, it simply hooks into your shell's pre-execution process.  No complex configurations or deep dives into your shell's inner workings are needed. \n\nThe benefits for developers are clear.  First and foremost, it saves you from accidental data loss.  We've all been there - a typo, a misplaced command, and suddenly hours of work vanish.  Shellfirm eliminates that risk.  Secondly, it improves your workflow by adding an extra layer of security without slowing you down.  The verification process is quick and painless.  Finally, it fosters better coding habits by encouraging more thoughtful command execution. You'll start to double-check your commands instinctively, preventing future mistakes. \n\nShellfirm isn't about slowing you down; it's about preventing catastrophic errors.  It's a lightweight, unobtrusive tool that provides a significant boost in security and peace of mind.  It's the little guardian angel watching over your terminal, ensuring that your next 'oops' moment remains just that – a moment, not a disaster.\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/kaplanelad/shellfirm)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
