It offers real-time monitoring, distributed architecture, and cloud-based alerting, supporting various data collection methods like metrics, logs, traces, and SNMP.\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ ServiceRadar is a distributed monitoring system specifically engineered for hard-to-reach and constrained network environments.\n\n* ✅ It features a unified data layer powered by CloudNativePG, TimescaleDB, and Apache AGE, enabling powerful topology mapping via its Graph Network Mapper.\n\n* ✅ The system supports comprehensive observability, collecting metrics, logs, and traces using standards like OpenTelemetry (OTEL) and SNMP.\n\n* ✅ Data querying is simplified using the intuitive ServiceRadar Query Language (SRQL).\n\n* ✅ Security is baked in with mTLS component authentication provided by SPIFFE, enforcing a strong zero-trust architecture.\n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 470\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 24\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 194\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ Elixir\n\n\nEver felt like your monitoring system only works when everything is already running smoothly? If you manage infrastructure in remote locations, constrained environments, or highly distributed setups, you know the pain of losing visibility when the network gets shaky. That's exactly the problem ServiceRadar is built to solve. This project is a game-changer for maintaining real-time awareness, even when your services are deployed in \"hard-to-reach places.\"\r\n\r\nServiceRadar operates on a truly distributed architecture, meaning you can place monitoring components right where they are needed, regardless of geographic or network segmentation. It’s designed to be the eyes and ears of your infrastructure, continuously gathering data. It doesn't just rely on one data source; it's a comprehensive observability platform that pulls in metrics, logs, and traces using industry standards like OpenTelemetry (OTEL), alongside traditional network tools like SNMP. This holistic view ensures no critical event slips through the cracks.\r\n\r\nOne of the most impressive aspects is its unified data layer. Forget juggling separate databases for different data types. ServiceRadar combines the power of relational data, time-series data (via TimescaleDB), and, crucially, graph data using Apache AGE. Why graph data? Because infrastructure is fundamentally a graph! This combination allows ServiceRadar's advanced discovery engine, the Graph Network Mapper, to automatically map complex device, interface, and topology relationships. You don't just see that two devices are up; you see *how* they are connected and the potential impact of a failure across the entire network map.\r\n\r\nFor developers and SREs, ServiceRadar offers immediate workflow improvements. Querying this massive, interconnected dataset is streamlined using SRQL, the ServiceRadar Query Language, which uses an intuitive key:value syntax—making complex data retrieval simple. Security is paramount, and the project enforces a zero-trust model using mTLS via SPIFFE, ensuring secure, certificate-based authentication for all components. Furthermore, its blazing-fast, Rust-based rule engine processes alerts and actions instantly, guaranteeing that you get informed the second something goes wrong, even if the primary network link is compromised. This level of comprehensive, secure, and distributed monitoring is essential for modern, complex deployments, giving you the peace of mind that your services are visible no matter where they are running.\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/carverauto/serviceradar)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
