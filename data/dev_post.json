Meet RedCoffee, Your CLI Report Generator!\npublished: True\ntags: sonarqube, python, cli, reporting\n---\n\n## Quick Summary: 📝\nRedCoffee is a Python-based command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to generate PDF reports from SonarQube Community Edition analysis data. It addresses the lack of native PDF export functionality in the community edition, making it easier to share and review code quality metrics.\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ RedCoffee generates professional PDF reports directly from SonarQube analysis data using a simple CLI.\n\n* ✅ It fills a critical feature gap by enabling PDF exports for users of the SonarQube Community Edition.\n\n* ✅ The tool is built in Python, allowing for easy installation and seamless integration into CI/CD pipelines.\n\n* ✅ It significantly reduces administrative overhead by automating the process of communicating code quality metrics to stakeholders.\n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 38\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 4\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 0\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ Python\n\n\nIf you've ever used SonarQube, especially the widely adopted Community Edition, you know it’s fantastic for deep code quality analysis. But when it comes time to share those results with stakeholders—the project manager, the client, or the compliance team—things get messy. You often end up taking screenshots or manually compiling data into presentations, which is time-consuming, prone to error, and ultimately unprofessional. This is exactly the pain point RedCoffee solves. It’s a powerful, straightforward command-line utility built in Python designed to take your raw SonarQube analysis data and instantly transform it into polished, professional PDF reports.\r\n\r\nRedCoffee operates by leveraging the SonarQube APIs. Once your project analysis is complete (a prerequisite for using the tool), RedCoffee connects, fetches the necessary metrics, and uses its internal templating system to structure this data beautifully. Think of it as an automated reporting layer sitting directly on top of your SonarQube instance. Since it's a CLI tool, integration into existing CI/CD pipelines or automated workflows is incredibly simple. A quick installation via `pip install redcoffee` and you’re ready to start generating comprehensive reports with just a single command, saving hours of manual data compilation and formatting.\r\n\r\nFor developers and DevOps engineers, RedCoffee is a massive workflow booster. It standardizes the output of code quality metrics, ensuring everyone—from the technical lead to the non-technical stakeholder—gets a consistent, easy-to-read overview of the project's health. This is particularly crucial for smaller teams or projects relying on the Community Edition where enterprise reporting features are locked behind a paywall. By automating this reporting process, you reduce administrative overhead significantly and can focus more time on writing great code and fixing the actual issues RedCoffee highlights in the final report.\r\n\r\nThe project structure is clean and well-organized, making it easy to contribute or understand how it functions. The core logic resides in the `analyser.py`, efficiently handling API calls, while the dedicated `reports` directory manages the look and feel through `templating.py`. This separation ensures that customizing the report structure or integrating new SonarQube metrics remains straightforward, offering flexibility while maintaining simplicity. It’s a robust, Python-based solution that truly empowers teams using open-source quality tools to present their findings professionally.\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/Anubhav9/RedCoffee)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
