It unifies REST, MCP, and A2A services, providing features like federation, security, observability, and multi-transport protocol support for AI clients. It can be deployed via PyPI or Docker and scales to multi-cluster Kubernetes environments.\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ The MCP Gateway unifies disparate service protocols (REST, MCP) into a single, compliant MCP endpoint for AI clients.\n\n* ✅ It acts as a smart proxy providing essential infrastructure features like centralized security, rate-limiting, and automated retries.\n\n* ✅ The gateway supports multi-cluster federation and scaling, using Redis for caching and state management in large environments.\n\n* ✅ Developers benefit from simplified architecture, reduced boilerplate code, and consolidated observability via a single entry point.\n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 2647\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 332\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 198\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ Python\n\n\nTired of juggling multiple endpoints and protocols just to connect your AI application to different services? That fragmented landscape—where some services use standard REST APIs, others use specialized protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol), and maybe even A2A (App-to-App) communication—is a massive headache for developers trying to build robust, scalable AI systems. This complexity introduces friction in crucial areas like security, service discovery, and reliability.\n\nThis is where the MCP Gateway steps in as the ultimate traffic cop and universal translator for your AI infrastructure. Think of it as a central hub that speaks every language your services use. Its primary purpose is unification: it takes all those disparate backend endpoints, whether they are standard REST APIs or services communicating via the Model Context Protocol, and presents them through one single, clean, compliant MCP server endpoint. This consolidation dramatically simplifies the client side of your AI application architecture.\n\nHow does the Gateway pull this off? It functions as a smart proxy and registry, handling crucial infrastructure needs right out of the box. Need robust security? It manages authentication and authorization centrally. Worried about service resilience? It includes built-in features like automated retries and rate-limiting to protect your backend services from overload, ensuring consistent performance even under heavy load. Furthermore, it supports federation, meaning if you deploy this gateway across multiple clusters or environments (like in a large Kubernetes setup, often backed by Redis for state sharing), it can discover and route traffic seamlessly across all of them.\n\nFor developers, this translates directly into massive time savings and simplified architecture. Instead of writing custom boilerplate logic to handle protocol translation, complex service discovery, virtual servers, and observability across various service types, you simply point your AI client at the MCP Gateway. It handles the heavy lifting, providing consolidated observability metrics and virtual server management, giving you a single pane of glass for monitoring your entire AI tool ecosystem. Deployment is incredibly flexible too—whether you prefer a quick setup via PyPI or leveraging robust containerization with Docker, you can get this powerful unification layer running quickly and scale it easily in multi-cluster environments. This project is a game-changer for anyone building complex, multi-service AI applications, turning infrastructure chaos into a streamlined, reliable system.\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/IBM/mcp-context-forge)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
