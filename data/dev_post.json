It aims to enhance the viewing experience by removing unwanted interruptions.\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ Automates skipping of intros, recaps, ads, and credits across multiple major streaming platforms.\n\n* ✅ Provides a truly seamless, uninterrupted binge-watching experience, saving significant time.\n\n* ✅ Supports platforms including Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, HBO, and Crunchyroll.\n\n* ✅ Implemented as a robust browser extension, demonstrating advanced content scripting techniques.\n\n* ✅ Eliminates manual interaction, allowing users to maintain viewing momentum effortlessly.\n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 458\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 45\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 6\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ JavaScript\n\n\nThe core frustration of modern streaming is the constant interruption. Whether it's the 30-second recap you just watched, the repetitive ten-second intro sequence, or the minutes-long credits roll, these moments shatter the immersive viewing experience. This project, \"Streaming enhanced,\" solves this by acting as an intelligent, automated assistant right inside your browser, eliminating these necessary but annoying pauses across multiple major platforms.\n\nThis extension operates by injecting lightweight scripts directly into the streaming service webpages. It doesn't rely on complex server-side APIs or heavy processing. Instead, it leverages knowledge of the specific user interface elements and timing cues used by services like Netflix, Prime Video, and Disney+. When the service displays a button or overlay signaling an opportunity to skip (e.g., \"Skip Intro,\" \"Next Episode,\" or the credit sequence detection), the extension instantly simulates the click action, often before the user even registers the prompt.\n\nThe real power lies in its broad compatibility. It supports a comprehensive list of streaming giants, including Crunchyroll and HBO, ensuring that your automated skipping preferences follow you regardless of where you are watching. This goes beyond simple intro skipping; it efficiently manages mid-roll ads where applicable, and ensures you transition immediately from episode credits to the next episode, maintaining that crucial viewing momentum.\n\nFor developers, this project is an excellent case study in robust browser extension architecture. It showcases advanced content scripting techniques necessary to interact reliably with dynamic, single-page applications (SPAs) like modern streaming sites. Understanding how it consistently identifies and manipulates elements across various proprietary interfaces provides valuable knowledge for anyone looking to build complex, user-facing utilities that modify third-party web behavior.\n\nUltimately, the benefit is pure, uninterrupted flow. By automating the mundane task of clicking 'skip,' developers and users alike reclaim valuable seconds that accumulate into hours of time saved. It transforms the act of binge-watching from a series of manual interactions back into the seamless, cinematic experience it was meant to be, making your downtime truly restful and efficient.\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/Dreamlinerm/Netflix-Prime-Auto-Skip)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
