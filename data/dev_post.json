It uses a novel multimodal approach called Heterogeneous Anchor Prompting to analyze and parse document images, extracting elements like text, figures, and tables in a structured manner. The model operates in two stages: layout analysis and parallel element parsing.\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ Dolphin uses a two-stage approach for efficient and accurate document image parsing.\n\n* ✅ It offers a lightweight architecture and parallel processing for superior speed.\n\n* ✅ Pre-trained models are readily available through Hugging Face and ModelScope.\n\n* ✅ The project supports multi-page PDF document parsing.\n\n* ✅ It's an open-source project with excellent documentation and community support.\n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 6610\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 538\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 59\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ Python\n\n\nTired of wrestling with complex document image parsing?  Meet Dolphin, a game-changing project that simplifies the process dramatically.  Imagine a world where extracting text, tables, and figures from scanned documents is as easy as it sounds – that's the promise of Dolphin.  This innovative model uses a clever two-stage approach. First, it analyzes the entire page, figuring out the layout and the order of elements just like a human would read it. Then, it efficiently parses each element individually using what the developers call 'heterogeneous anchors'. Think of these anchors as smart pointers that guide the model to the right information, making the parsing super accurate and fast.  Dolphin isn't just about accuracy; it's also about speed and efficiency. Its lightweight architecture and parallel processing capabilities mean you get results quickly, even with large documents.  The project is open-source, meaning you can easily integrate it into your own workflows.  Whether you're building an OCR application, automating data entry, or working on any project that involves document processing, Dolphin offers a significant advantage.  It's been tested on various datasets and consistently delivers impressive results, outperforming many existing solutions. What's more, it supports multiple page PDFs, enhancing its versatility.  The project offers pre-trained models readily available through Hugging Face and ModelScope, making it incredibly easy to get started.  There's even a handy online demo to try before you commit!  The team behind Dolphin has also provided excellent documentation and support, making the integration process smooth and straightforward. If you're looking to improve your document processing pipeline, save time, and boost your efficiency, look no further than Dolphin.  It's a powerful, versatile, and easy-to-use tool that's set to revolutionize how we handle document images.\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/bytedance/Dolphin)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
