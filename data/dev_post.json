It offers real-time insights, intelligent auto-restart capabilities, multi-channel alerting, and detailed event logging for single or multiple Docker hosts.\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ Centralized monitoring and management for unlimited local and remote Docker hosts.\n\n* ✅ Intelligent auto-restart and proactive HTTP health checks ensure high container uptime.\n\n* ✅ Secure remote monitoring via a lightweight Go agent, eliminating the need to expose Docker ports.\n\n* ✅ Real-time dashboards, multi-channel alerting (Slack, Discord), and comprehensive event logging simplify operations.\n\n* ✅ Supports bulk operations and integrated deployment using reusable Docker Compose templates.\n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 1136\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 64\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 20\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ Python\n\n\nTired of SSHing into a dozen servers just to check if your containers are still breathing? DockMon completely changes the game by offering a single, beautiful dashboard to manage all your Docker environments, whether they are running locally or scattered across the globe. This tool is designed to move you beyond basic `docker ps` commands and give you true operational oversight, turning container chaos into predictable control.\n\nThe magic of DockMon lies in its architecture, especially when dealing with remote hosts. Instead of forcing you to expose risky Docker ports, it uses a lightweight, secure Go-based agent that runs on your remote servers. This agent securely relays real-time performance metrics—CPU, memory, network usage—back to the central platform. Everything updates live via WebSockets, meaning your customizable dashboard is always showing the absolute truth about your infrastructure the moment it happens. You can even view live logs from multiple containers side-by-side, which is a massive time saver during debugging.\n\nFor developers seeking reliability, DockMon’s intelligent auto-restart feature is a lifesaver. You can define specific retry logic for individual containers. If a critical service crashes, DockMon doesn't just blindly try to restart it once; it follows your rules, ensuring transient failures don't become outages. Furthermore, built-in HTTP/HTTPS health checks provide proactive monitoring, allowing the system to restart containers based on application response, not just process status.\n\nAlerting is another area where DockMon shines brightly. Forget constantly polling your infrastructure. This platform integrates seamlessly with all the communication tools you already use, including Slack, Discord, Telegram, and traditional SMTP. You get instant, actionable notifications when something goes wrong, and you can even define \"Blackout Windows\" to suppress alerts during scheduled maintenance, preventing notification fatigue.\n\nFinally, managing your workflow becomes incredibly streamlined. Need to update a fleet of containers? Bulk operations allow you to stop, start, or restart dozens of containers with a few clicks. For deployment, it supports both simple Docker Run style commands and complex Docker Compose templates, which you can save and reuse. This centralization of monitoring, management, and deployment transforms how you interact with your containerized applications, giving you back precious development time previously spent on operational firefighting.\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/darthnorse/dockmon)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
