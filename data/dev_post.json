It provides metric point maps, depth maps, normal maps, and camera FOV estimation. The model supports flexible resolutions, optional ground-truth FOV input, and is optimized for speed, making it suitable for various applications requiring monocular geometry estimation.\n\n## Key Takeaways: 💡\n\n* ✅ Accurate 3D geometry estimation from single images (monocular vision)\n\n* ✅ Handles various image resolutions and aspect ratios\n\n* ✅ Fast inference speed (60ms per image on high-end hardware)\n\n* ✅ Open-domain applicability (works on a wide variety of images)\n\n* ✅ Improved accuracy and features in MoGe-2, including metric-scale point maps and normal maps\n\n\n## Project Statistics: 📊\n* ⭐ **Stars:** 1350\n* 🍴 **Forks:** 74\n* ❗ **Open Issues:** 33\n\n\n## Tech Stack: 💻\n- ✅ Python\n\n\nHey fellow developers! Ever wished you could pull accurate 3D geometry straight from a single image?  Meet MoGe, a groundbreaking model that does just that!  Imagine the possibilities:  building immersive AR experiences, creating realistic 3D models from photos, or even enhancing robotics perception.  This isn't some theoretical concept; MoGe is a real, powerful tool, and it's open-source! \n\nMoGe excels at estimating several key aspects of a scene's 3D structure from a single image (monocular vision). This includes creating accurate point maps (think of it as a cloud of 3D points representing the scene), depth maps (showing how far away each point is from the camera), and even normal maps (indicating the direction of surfaces).  It's like having a mini 3D scanner built directly into your code! \n\nWhat sets MoGe apart is its versatility and accuracy.  Unlike some specialized solutions, MoGe works on a wide variety of images – it's 'open-domain'.  It also gives you the option to feed it the camera's field of view (FOV) for even better precision.  Need to process images of different sizes? No problem! MoGe is designed to handle various resolutions and aspect ratios with ease.  And speed?  MoGe is optimized to be surprisingly fast, achieving 60ms per image on high-end hardware.  But it's designed to be flexible, so you can adjust the resolution for even faster processing if you need it.\n\nSo, what's in it for you?  Well, if you're working on AR/VR, robotics, 3D reconstruction, or any project needing accurate 3D scene understanding, MoGe is a game-changer. It saves you the hassle of complex, multi-camera setups or expensive 3D scanning equipment. The ability to generate metric depth maps and point clouds directly from single images opens a whole new world of creative and practical applications.  You can integrate MoGe into your existing projects to improve the accuracy and efficiency of your 3D vision systems. The code is clean, well-documented, and easy to integrate into your workflow. Plus, it's backed by Microsoft, which adds a layer of confidence in terms of quality and support.\n\nMoGe has recently been updated to version 2, offering significant improvements in accuracy, visual sharpness, and inference speed.  The updated model also provides metric-scale point map predictions, meaning the distances in your 3D model are now accurately represented in real-world units.  This level of precision is a major leap forward in monocular geometry estimation.  And there's more: MoGe-2 now also provides high-quality normal maps, adding another dimension to its 3D reconstruction capabilities.\n\nReady to dive in?  The project is available on GitHub, with easy-to-follow installation instructions and pre-trained models available through Hugging Face.  Check out their website for interactive demos and videos that showcase MoGe's incredible power. Trust me, once you see it in action, you'll be hooked!  This is a project that will significantly impact the way we interact with and understand the 3D world around us, and it's yours to explore.\n\n## Learn More: 🔗\n[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/MoGe)\n\n---\n## 🌟 Stay Connected with GitHub Open Source!\n\n> 📱 **Join us on Telegram**  \n> Get daily updates on the best open-source projects  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://t.me/GitHub_Open_Source)\n\n> 👥 **Follow us on Facebook**  \n> Connect with our community and never miss a discovery  \n> [GitHub Open Source](https://www.facebook.com/people/GitHub-Open-Source/61571925474856/)",
